Father Ryan's Poems


By Abram J. Ryan, (Father Ryan)




Introduction:



In preparing this electronic text of Father Ryan's poems,
I was struck by the biased nature of the memoir included.
While I will not gainsay anyone's right to their beliefs,
I believe it is clearly evident from the poems themselves
that Father Ryan believed strongly in the Southern Cause,
and I do not believe his reaction was entirely emotional,
as seems to be implied.  The Memoir also makes mention of
Father Ryan's poem "Reunited", as evidence of his support
for the reunification of the States.  To be fair to Ryan,
I would note that such stanzas as
  
    "The Northern heart and the Southern heart
     May beat in peace again;
  
    "But still till time's last day,
     Whatever lips may plight,
    The blue is blue, but the gray is gray,
     Wrong never accords with Right."
  
in `Sentinel Songs', are much more common in his poems.
