Changes to the text
===================

  Page-breaks have been removed, along with page numbers and column
titles.

  End-of-line hyphenations have been removed, and the de-hyphenated
word has been brought up to the first of the two lines. The text
itself has been the main guide for keeping or removing hyphens.

  The following changes have been made to the text:

p. 26, l. 24-27: `She is a [...] may concern.' ''

	 The printed edition has a double quote in the
	first line, and a double quote in the last.
	But it is clearly a quote within a quote - hence
	the change.

p. 53, l.9: I cannot tell''			(missing '')

Footnotes

  Footnotes in the text were placed at the foot of the page; in this
edition they have been placed immediately after the line in which they
are referenced. The footnote callout is always an asterisk,* and the
text of the footnote has been

*    Like this

placed, slightly indented, between two empty lines, with an asterisk

                MADAME DELPHINE.



                 CHAPTER I.

                AN OLD HOUSE.

  A few steps from the St. Charles Hotel, in New
Orleans, brings you to and across Canal Street, the
central avenue of the city, and to that corner where
the flower-women sit at the inner and outer edges of
the arcaded sidewalk, and make the air sweet with
their fragrant merchandise. The crowd---and if it is
near the time of the carnival it will be great---will
follow Canal Street.

  But you turn, instead, into  the quiet, narrow way
which a lover of Creole antiquity, in fondness for a
romantic past, is still prone to call the Rue Royale.
You will pass a few restaurants, a few auction-rooms,
a few furniture warehouses, and will hardly realize that
you have left behind you the activity and clatter of a
city of merchants before you find yourself in a region
of architectural decrepitude, where an ancient and
foreign-seeming domestic life, in second stories, overhangs
the ruins of a former commercial prosperity, and
upon every thing has settled down a long sabbath of
decay. The vehicles in the street are few in number,
and are merely passing through; the stores are shrunken
into shops; you see here and there, like a patch of
bright mould, the stall of that significant fungus, the
Chinaman. Many great doors are shut and clamped
and grown gray with cobweb; many street windows
are nailed up; half the balconies are begrimed and
rust-eaten, and many of the humid arches and alleys
which characterize the older Franco-Spanish piles of
stuccoed brick betray a squalor almost oriental.

  Yet beauty lingers here. To say nothing of the picturesque,
sometimes you get sight of comfort, sometimes
of opulence, through the unlatched wicket in
some _porte-coch<e`>re_---red-painted brick pavement, foliage
of dark palm or pale banana, marble or granite
masonry and blooming parterres; or through a chink
between some pair of heavy batten window-shutters,
opened with an almost reptile wariness, your eye gets
a glimpse of lace and brocade upholstery, silver and
bronze, and much similar rich antiquity.

  The faces of the inmates are in keeping; of the
passengers in the street a sad proportion are dingy
and shabby; but just when these are putting you off
your guard, there will pass you a woman---more
likely two or three---of patrician beauty.

  Now, if you will go far enough down this old street,
you will see, as you approach its intersection with ------
Names in that region elude one like ghosts.

  However, as you begin to find the way a trifle more
open, you will not fail to notice on the, right-hand side,
about midway of the square, a small, low, brick house
of a story and a half, set out upon the sidewalk, as
weather-beaten and mute as an aged beggar fallen
asleep. Its corrugated roof of dull red tiles, sloping
down toward you with an inward curve, is overgrown
with weeds, and in the fall of the year is gay with the
yellow plumes of the golden-rod. You can almost
touch with your cane the low edge of the broad, overhanging
eaves. The batten shutters at door and window,
with hinges like those of a postern, are shut with
a grip that makes one's knuckles and nails feel lacerated.
Save in the brick-work itself there is not a
cranny. You would say the house has the lockjaw. 
There are two doors, and to each a single chipped and
battered marble step. Continuing on down the sidewalk,
on a line with the house, is a garden masked
from view by a high, close board-fence. You may
see the tops of its fruit-trees---pomegranate, peach,
banana, fig, pear, and particularly one large orange,
close by the fence, that must be very old.

  The residents over the narrow way, who live in a
three-story house, originally of much pretension, but
from whose front door hard times have removed almost
all vestiges of paint, will tell you:

  ``Yass, de 'ouse is in'abit; 'tis live in.''

  And this is likely to be all the information you get---
not that they would not tell, but they cannot grasp the
idea that you wish to know---until, possibly, just as
you are turning to depart, your informant, in a single
word and with the most evident non-appreciation of its
value, drops the simple key to the whole matter:

  ``Dey's quadroons.''

  He may then be aroused to mention the better appearance
of the place in former years, when the houses
of this region generally stood farther apart, and that
garden comprised the whole square.

  Here dwelt, sixty years ago and more, one Delphine
Carraze; or, as she was commonly designated by the
few who knew her, Madame Delphine. That she
owned her home, and that it had been given her by the
then deceased companion of her days of beauty, were
facts so generally admitted as to be, even as far back
as that sixty years ago, no longer a subject of gossip. 
She was never pointed out by the denizens of the quarter
as a character, nor her house as a ``feature.'' It
would have passed all Creole powers of guessing to
divine what you could find worthy of inquiry concerning
a retired quadroon woman; and not the least puzzled
of all would have been the timid and restive
Madame Delphine herself.



                 CHAPTER II.

               MADAME DELPINE.

  During the first quarter of the present century, the
free quadroon caste of New Orleans was in its golden
age. Earlier generations---sprung, upon the one hand,
from the merry gallants of a French colonial military
service which had grown gross by affiliation with Spanish-American
frontier life, and, upon the other hand,
from comely Ethiopians culled out of the less negroidal
types of African live goods, and bought at the
ship's side with vestiges of quills and cowries and
copper wire still in their head-dresses,---these earlier
generations, with scars of battle or private rencontre
still on the fathers, and of servitude on the manumitted
mothers, afforded a mere hint of the splendor that
was to result from a survival of the fairest through
seventy-five years devoted to the elimination of the
black pigment and the cultivation of hyperian excellence
and nymphean grace and beauty. Nor, if we
turn to the present, is the evidence much stronger
which is offered by the _gens de couleur_ whom you may
see in the quadroon quarter this afternoon, with ``Ichabod''
legible on their murky foreheads through a vain
smearing of toilet powder, dragging their chairs down
to the narrow gateway of their close-fenced gardens,
and staring shrinkingly at you as you pass, like a nest
of yellow kittens.

  But as the present century was in its second and
third decades, the _quadroones_ (for we must contrive a
feminine spelling to define the strict limits of the caste
as then established) came forth in splendor. Old travellers
spare no terms to tell their praises, their faultlessness
of feature, their perfection of form, their varied
styles of beauty,---for there were even pure Caucasian
blondes among them,---their fascinating manners, their
sparkling vivacity, their chaste and pretty wit, their
grace in the dance, their  modest propriety, their taste
and elegance in dress. In the gentlest and most
poetic sense they were indeed the sirens of this land,
where it seemed ``always afternoon''---a momentary
triumph of an Arcadian over a Christian civilization, so
beautiful and so seductive that it became the subject
of special chapters by writers of the day more original
than correct as social philosophers.

  The balls that were got up for them by the male
_sang-pur_ were to that day what the carnival is to the
present. Society balls given the same nights proved
failures through the coincidence. The magnates of
government,---municipal, state, federal,---those of the
army, of the learned professions and of the clubs,---in
short, the white male aristocracy in every thing save
the ecclesiastical desk,---were there. Tickets were
high-priced to insure the exclusion of the vulgar. No
distinguished stranger was allowed to miss them. 
They were beautiful! They were clad in silken extenuations
from the throat to the feet, and wore,
withal, a pathos in their charm that gave them a family
likeness to innocence.

  Madame Delphine, were you not a stranger, could
have told you all about it; though hardly, I suppose,
without tears.

  But at the time of which we would speak (1821--22)
her day of splendor was set, and her husband---let us
call him so for her sake---was long dead. He was an
American, and, if we take her word for it, a man of
noble heart and extremely handsome; but this is
knowledge which we can do without.

  Even in those days the house was always shut, and
Madame Delphine's chief occupation and end in life
seemed to be to keep well locked up in-doors. She
was an excellent person, the neighbors said,---a very
worthy person; and they were, maybe, nearer correct
then they knew. They rarely saw her save when she
went to or returned from church; a small, rather tired-looking,
dark quadroone of very good features and a
gentle thoughtfulness of expression which would take
long to describe: call it a widow's look.

  In speaking of Madame Delphine's house, mention
should have been made of a gate in the fence on the
Royal-street sidewalk. It is gone now, and was out
of use then, being fastened once for all by an iron
staple clasping the cross-bar and driven into the
post.

  Which leads us to speak of another person.


                CHAPTER III.

             CAPITAINE LEMAITRE.

  He was one of those men that might be any age,
thirty, forty, forty-five; there was no telling from his
face what was years and what was only weather. His
countenance was of a grave and quiet, but also luminous,
sort, which was instantly admired and ever
afterward remembered, as was also the fineness of his
hair and the blueness of his eyes. Those pronounced
him youngest who scrutinized his face the closest. 
But waiving the discussion of age, he was odd, though
not with the oddness that he who had reared him
had striven to produce.

  He had not been brought up by mother or father. 
He had lost both in infancy, and had fallen to the care
of a rugged old military grandpa of the colonial school,
whose unceasing endeavor had been to make ``his
boy'' as savage and ferocious a holder of unimpeachable
social rank as it became a pure-blooded French
Creole to be who would trace his pedigree back to the
god Mars.

  ``Remember, my boy,'' was the adjuration received
by him as regularly as his waking cup of black coffee,
``that none of your family line ever kept the laws of
any government or creed.'' And if it was well that
he should bear this in mind, it was well to reiterate it
persistently, for, from the nurse's arms, the boy wore
a look, not of docility so much as of gentle, _judicial_
benevolence. The domestics of the old man's house
used to shed tears of laughter to see that look on the
face of a babe. His rude guardian addressed himself
to the modification of this facial expression; it had not
enough of majesty in it, for instance, or of large dare-deviltry;
but with care these could be made to come.

  And, true enough, at twenty-one (in Ursin Lemaitre),
the labors of his grandfather were an apparent
success. He was not rugged, nor was he loud-spoken,
as his venerable trainer would have liked to present
him to society; but he was as serenely terrible as a
well-aimed rifle, and the old man looked upon his results
with pride. He had cultivated him up to that
pitch where he scorned to practise any vice, or any
virtue, that did not include the principle of self-assertion.
A few touches only were wanting here and there
to achieve perfection, when suddenly the old man died. 
Yet it was his proud satisfaction, before he finally lay
down, to see Ursin a favored companion and the peer,
both in courtesy and pride, of those polished gentlemen
famous in history, the brothers Lafitte.

  The two Lafittes were, at the time young Lemaitre
reached his majority (say 1808 or 1812), only merchant-blacksmiths,
so to speak, a term intended to
convey the idea of blacksmiths who never soiled their
hands, who were men of capital, stood a little higher
than the clergy, and moved in society among its autocrats.
But they were full of possibilities, men of
action, and men, too, of thought, with already a pronounced
disbelief in the custom-house. In these days
of big carnivals they would have been patented as the
dukes of Little Manchac and Barataria.

  Young Ursin Lemaitre (in full the name was Lemaitre-Vignevielle)
had not only the hearty friendship
of these good people, but also a natural turn for accounts;
and as his two friends were looking about them
with an enterprising eye, it easily resulted that he
presently connected himself with the blacksmithing
profession. Not exactly at the forge in the Lafittes'
famous smithy, among the African Samsons, who,
with their shining black bodies bared to the waist,
made the Rue St. Pierre ring with the stroke of their
hammers; but as a---there was no occasion to mince
the word in those days---smuggler.

  Smuggler---patriot---where was the  difference?
Beyond the ken of a community to which the enforcement
of the revenue laws had long been merely so
much out of every man's pocket and dish, into the
all-devouring treasury of Spain. At this date they
had come under a kinder yoke, and to a treasury that
at least echoed when the customs were dropped into it;
but the change was still new. What could a man be
more than Capitaine Lemaitre was---the soul of honor,
the pink of courtesy, with the courage of the lion, and
the magnanimity of the elephant; frank---the very
exchequer of truth! Nay, go higher still: his paper
was good in Toulouse Street. To the gossips in the
gaming-clubs he was the culminating proof that smuggling
was one of the sublimer virtues.

  Years went by. Events transpired which have their
place in history. Under a government which the community
by and by saw was conducted in their interest,
smuggling began to lose its respectability and to grow
disreputable, hazardous, and debased. In certain onslaughts
made upon them by officers of the law, some
of the smugglers became murderers. The business
became unprofitable for a time until the enterprising
Lafittes---thinkers---bethought them of a corrective
---``privateering.''

  Thereupon the United States Government set a price
upon their heads. Later yet it became known that
these outlawed pirates had been offered money and
rank by Great Britain if they would join her standard,
then hovering about the water-approaches to their native
city, and that they had spurned the bribe; wherefore
their heads were ruled out of the market, and,
meeting and treating with Andrew Jackson, they were
received as lovers of their country, and as compatriots
fought in the battle of New Orleans at the head of
their fearless men, and---here tradition takes up the
tale---were never seen afterward.

  Capitaine Lemaitre was not among the killed or
wounded, but he was among the missing.



                 CHAPTER IV.

               THREE FRIENDS.

  The roundest and happiest-looking priest in the city
of New Orleans was a little man fondly known among
his people as P<e`>re Jerome. He was a Creole and a
member of one of the city's leading families. His
dwelling was a little frame cottage, standing on  high
pillars just inside a tall, close fence, and reached by a
narrow out-door stair from the green batten gate. It
was well surrounded by crape myrtles, and communicated
behind by a descending stair and a plank-walk
with the rear entrance of the chapel over whose worshippers
he daily spread his hands in benediction. 
The name of the street---ah! there is where light is
wanting. Save the Cathedral and the Ursulines, there
is very little of record concerning churches at that
time, though they were springing up here and there. 
All there is certainty of is that P<e`>re Jerome's frame
chapel was some little new-born ``down-town'' thing,
that may have survived the passage of years, or may
have escaped ``Paxton's Directory'' ``so as by fire.''
His parlor was dingy and carpetless; one could smell
distinctly there the vow of poverty. His bed-chamber
was bare and clean, and the bed in it narrow and hard;
but between the two was a dining-room that would
tempt a laugh to the lips of any who looked in. The
table was small, but stout, and all the furniture of the
room substantial, made of fine wood, and carved just
enough to give the notion of wrinkling pleasantry.
His mother's and sister's doing, P<e`>re Jerome would
explain; they would not permit this apartment---or
department---to suffer. Therein, as well as in the
parlor, there was odor, but of a more epicurean sort,
that explained interestingly the P<e`>re Jerome's rotundity
and rosy smile.

  In this room, and about this miniature round table,
used sometimes to sit with P<e`>re Jerome two friends to
whom he was deeply attached---one, Evariste Varrillat,
a playmate from early childhood, now his brother-in-law;
the other, Jean Thompson, a companion from
youngest manhood, and both, like the little priest himself,
the regretful rememberers of a fourth comrade
who was a comrade no more. Like P<e`>re Jerome, they
had come, through years, to the thick of life's conflicts,
---the priest's brother-in-law a physician, the other an
attorney, and brother-in-law to the lonely wanderer,---
yet they loved to huddle around this small board, and
be boys again in heart while men in mind. Neither
one nor another was leader. In earlier days they had
always yielded to him who no longer met with them a
certain chieftainship, and they still thought of him and
talked of him, and, in their conjectures, groped after
him, as one of whom they continued to expect greater
things than of themselves.

  They sat one day drawn thus close together, sipping
and theorizing, speculating upon the nature of things
in an easy, bold, sophomoric way, the conversation for
the most part being in French, the native tongue of
the doctor and priest, and spoken with facility by Jean
Thompson the lawyer, who was half Am<e'>ricain; but
running sometimes into English and sometimes into
mild laughter. Mention had been made of the absentee.

  P<e`>re Jerome advanced an idea something like this:

  ``It is impossible for any finite mind to fix the
degree of criminality of any human act or of any human
life. The Infinite One alone can know how much
of our sin is chargeable to us, and how much to our
brothers or our fathers. We all participate in one
another's sins. There is a community of responsibility
attaching to every misdeed. No human since Adam
---nay, nor Adam himself---ever sinned entirely to
himself. And so I never am called upon to contemplate
a crime or a criminal but I feel my conscience
pointing at me as one of the accessories.''

  ``In a word,'' said Evariste Varrillat, the physician,
``you think we are partly to blame for the omission
of many of your Paternosters, eh?''

  Father Jerome smiled.

  ``No; a man cannot plead so in his own defence;
our first father tried that, but the plea was not allowed.
But, now, there is our absent friend. I tell
you truly this whole community ought to be recognized
as partners in his moral errors. Among another people,
reared under wiser care and with better companions,
how different might be not have been! How
can we speak of him as a law-breaker who might have
saved him from that name?'' Here the speaker turned
to Jean Thompson, and changed his speech to English.
``A lady sez to me to-day: `P<e`>re Jerome, 'ow
dat is a dreadfool dat 'e gone at de coas' of Cuba to
be one corsair! Ain't it?' `Ah, madame,' I sez,
` 'tis a terrible! I 'ope de good God will fo'give me
an' you fo' dat!' ''

  Jean Thompson answered quickly:

  ``You should not have let her say that.''

  ``_Mais_, fo' w'y?''

  ``Why, because, if you are partly responsible, you
ought so much the more to do what you can to shield
his reputation. You should have said,''---the attorney
changed to French,---`` `He is no pirate; he has
merely taken out letters of marque and reprisal under
the flag of the republic of Carthagena!' ''

  ``_Ah, bah!_'' exclaimed Doctor Varrillat, and both
he and his brother-in-law, the priest, laughed.

  ``Why not?'' demanded Thompson.

  ``Oh!'' said the physician, with a shrug, ``say id
thad way iv you wand.''

  Then, suddenly becoming serious, he was about to
add something else, when P<e`>re Jerome spoke.

  ``I will tell you what I could have said. I could
have said: `Madame, yes; 'tis a terrible fo' him. He
stum'le in de dark; but dat good God will mek it a
_mo' terrible_ fo' dat man oohever he is, w'at put 'at
light out!' ''

  ``But how do you know he is a pirate?'' demanded
Thompson, aggrressively.

  ``How do we know?'' said the little priest, returning
to French. ``Ah! there is no other explanation
of the ninety-and-nine stories that come to us, from
every port where ships arrive from the north coast of
Cuba, of a commander of pirates there who is a marvel
of courtesy and gentility''---*

*  See gazettes of the period.


  ``And whose name is Lafitte,'' said the obstinate
attorney.

  ``And who, nevertheless, is not Lafitte,'' insisted
P<e`>re Jerome.

  ``Daz troo, Jean,'' said Doctor Varrillat. ``We
hall know daz troo.''

  P<e`>re Jerome leaned forward over the board and
spoke, with an air of secrecy, in French.

  ``You have beard of the ship which came into port
here last Monday. You have heard that she was
boarded by pirates, and that the captain of the ship
himself drove them off.''

  ``An incredible story,'' said Thompson.

  ``But not so incredible as the truth. I have it from
a passenger. There was on the ship a young girl who
was very beautiful. She came on deck, where the
corsair stood, about to issue his orders, and, more
beautiful than ever in the desperation of the moment,
confronted him with a small missal spread open, and,
her finger on the Apostles' Creed, commanded him to
read. He read it, uncovering his head as he read, then
stood gazing on her face, which did not quail; and
then with a low bow, said: `Give me this book and I
will do your bidding.' She gave him the book and
bade him leave the ship, and he left it unmolested.''

  P<e`>re Jerome looked from the physician to the attorney
and back again, once or twice, with his dimpled
smile.

  ``But  he speaks English, they say,'' said Jean
Thompson.

  ``He  has, no  doubt, learned  it  since  he  left  us,''
said the priest.

  ``But this ship-master, too, says  his  men  called  him
Lafitte.''

  ``Lafitte? No. Do you not see? It is your brother-in-law,
Jean Thompson! It is your wife's brother!
Not Lafitte, but'' (softly) ``Lemaitre! Lemaitre!
Capitaine Ursin Lemaitre!''

  The two guests looked at each other with a growing
drollery on either face, and presently broke into a laugh.

  ``Ah!'' said the doctor, as the three rose up, ``you
juz kip dad cog-an'-bull fo' yo' negs summon.''

  P<e`>re Jerome's eyes lighted up---

  ``I goin' to do it!''

  ``I tell you,'' said Evariste, turning upon him with
sudden gravity, ``iv dad is troo, I tell you w'ad is
sure-sure! Ursin Lemaitre din kyare nut'n fo' doze
creed; _he fall in love!_''

  Then, with a smile, turning to Jean Thompson, and
back again to P<e`>re Jerome:

  ``But anny'ow you tell it in dad summon dad 'e
kyare fo' dad creed.''

  P<e`>re Jerome sat up late that night, writing a letter. 
The remarkable effects upon a certain mind, effects
which we shall presently find him attributing solely to
the influences of surrounding nature, may find for some
a more sufficient explanation in the fact that this letter
was but one of a series, and that in the rover of doubted
identity and incredible eccentricity P<e`>re Jerome had a
regular correspondent.


                 CHAPTER V.

               THE CAP FITS.

  About two months after the conversation just given,
and therefore somewhere about the Christmas holidays
of the year 1821, P<e`>re Jerome delighted the congregation
of his little chapel with the announcement that he
had appointed to preach a sermon in French on the
following sabbath---not there, but in the cathedral.

  He was much beloved. Notwithstanding that among
the clergy there were two or three who shook their heads
and raised their eyebrows, and said he would be at
least as orthodox if he did not make quite so much of
the Bible and quite so little of the dogmas, yet ``the
common people heard him gladly.'' When told, one
day, of the unfavorable whispers, he smiled a little
and answered his informant,---whom he knew to be
one of the whisperers himself,---laying a hand kindly
upon his shoulder:

  ``Father Murphy,''---or whatever the name was,---
``your words comfort me.''

  ``How is that?''

  ``Because---`_V<ae> quum benedixerint mihi homines!_' ''*

* Woe unto me when all men speak well of me!


  The appointed morning, when it came, was one of
those exquisite days in which there is such a universal
harmony, that worship rises from the heart like a
spring.

  ``Truly,'' said P<e`>re Jerome to the companion who
was to assist him in the mass, ``this is a sabbath day
which we do not have to make holy, but only to _keep_
so.''

  Maybe it was one of the secrets of P<e`>re Jerome's
success as a preacher, that he took more thought as to
how he should feel, than as to what he should say.

  The cathedral of those days was called a very plain
old pile, boasting neither beauty nor riches; but to
P<e`>re Jerome it was very lovely; and before its homely
altar, not homely to him, in the performance of those
solemn offices, symbols of heaven's mightiest truths,
in the hearing of the organ's harmonies, and the yet
more eloquent interunion of human voices in the choir,
in overlooking the worshipping throng which knelt
under the soft, chromatic lights, and in breathing the
sacrificial odors of the chancel, he found a deep and
solemn joy; and yet I guess the finest thought of his
soul the while was one that came thrice and again:

  ``Be not deceived, P<e`>re Jerome, because saintliness
of feeling is easy here; you are the same priest who
overslept this morning, and over-ate yesterday, and
will, in some way, easily go wrong to-morrow and the
day after.''

  He took it with him when---the _Veni Creator_ sung
---he went into the pulpit. Of the sermon he preached,
tradition has preserved for us only a few brief sayings,
but they are strong and sweet.

  ``My friends,'' he said,---this was near the beginning,
---``the angry words of God's book are very
merciful---they are meant to drive us home; but the
tender words, my friends, they are sometimes terrible!
Notice these, the tenderest words of the tenderest
prayer that ever came from the lips of a blessed martyr
---the dying words of the holy Saint Stephen, `Lord,
lay not this sin to their charge.' Is there nothing
dreadful in that? Read it thus: `Lord, lay not this
sin to _their_ charge.' Not to the charge of them who
stoned him? To whose charge then? Go ask the holy
Saint Paul. Three years afterward, praying in the
temple at Jerusalem, he answered that question: `I
stood by and consented.' He answered for himself
only; but the Day must come when all that wicked
council that sent Saint Stephen away to be stoned, and
all that city of Jerusalem, must hold up the hand and
say : ` We, also, Lord---we stood by.' Ah! friends,
under the simpler meaning of that dying saint's prayer
for the pardon of his murderers is hidden the terrible
truth that we all have a share in one another's sins.''

  Thus P<e`>re  Jerome  touched  his  key-note. All  that
time has spared us beside may be given in a few sentences.

  ``Ah!'' he cried once, ``if it were merely my own
sins that I had to answer for, I might hold up my head
before the rest of mankind; but no, no, my friends---
we cannot look each other in the face, for each has
helped the other to sin. Oh, where is there any room,
in this world of common disgrace, for pride? Even
if we had no common hope, a common despair ought
to bind us together and forever silence the voice of
scorn!''

  And again, this:

  ``Even in the promise to No<e:>, not again to destroy
the race with a flood, there is a whisper of solemn
warning. The moral account of the antediluvians was
closed off and the balance brought down in the year
of the deluge; but the account of those who come after
runs on and on, and the blessed bow of promise itself
warns us that God will not stop it till the Judgment
Day! O God, I thank thee that that day must come at
last, when thou wilt destroy the world, and stop the
interest on my account!''

  It was about at this point that P<e`>re Jerome noticed,
more particularly than he had done before, sitting
among the worshippers near him, a small, sad-faced
woman, of pleasing features, but dark and faded, who
gave him profound attention. With her was another in
better dress, seemingly a girl still in her teens, though
her face and neck were scrupulously concealed by a
heavy veil, and her hands, which were small, by gloves.

  ``Quadroones,'' thought he, with a  stir  of  deep  pity.

  Once, as he uttered some stirring word, he saw the
mother and daughter (if such they were), while they
still bent their gaze upon him, clasp each other's hand
fervently in the daughter's lap. It was at these words:

  ``My friends, there are thousands of people in this
city of New Orleans to whom society gives the ten
commandments of God with all the _nots_ rubbed out!
Ah! good gentlemen! if God sends the poor weakling
to purgatory for leaving the right path, where ought
some of you to go who strew it with thorns and briers!''

  The movement of the pair was only seen because he
watched for it. He glanced that way again as he said:

  ``O God, be very gentle with those children who
would be nearer heaven this day had they never had a
father and mother, but had got their religious training
from such a sky and earth as we have in Louisiana
this holy morning! Ah! my friends, nature is a big-print
catechism!''

  The mother and daughter leaned a little farther forward,
and exchanged, the same spasmodic hand-pressure
as before. The mother's eyes were full of tears.

  ``I once knew a man,'' continued the little priest,
glancing to a side aisle where he had noticed Evariste
and Jean sitting against each other, ``who was carefully
taught, from infancy to manhood, this single only
principle of life: defiance. Not justice, not righteousness,
not even gain; but defiance: defiance to God,
defiance to man, defiance to nature, defiance to reason;
defiance and defiance and defiance.''

  ``He is going to tell it!'' murmured Evariste to
Jean.

  ``This  man,'' continued P<e`>re Jerome, ``became a
smuggler and at  last  a  pirate  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.
Lord, lay  not  that  sin  to  his charge alone! But a
strange  thing  followed. Being  in command of men of
a sort that to control required to be kept at the austerest
distance, he now found himself separated from the
human world and thrown into the solemn companionship
with the sea, with the air, with the storm, the calm,
the heavens by day, the heavens by night. My friends,
that was the first time in his life that he ever found
himself in really good company.

  ``Now, this man had a great aptness for accounts. 
He had kept them---had rendered them. There was
beauty, to him, in a correct, balanced, and closed account.
An account unsatisfied was a deformity. The
result is plain. That man, looking out night after
night upon the grand and holy spectacle of the starry
deep above and the watery deep below, was sure to
find himself, sooner or later, mastered by the conviction
that the great Author of this majestic creation
keeps account of it; and one night there came to him,
like a spirit walking on the sea, the awful, silent question:
`My account with God---how does it stand?'
Ah! friends, that is a question which the book of
nature does not answer.

  ``Did I say the book of nature is a catechism? Yes. 
But, after it answers the first question with `God,'
nothing but questions follow; and so, one day, this
man gave a ship full of merchandise for one little book
which answered those questions. God help him to
understand it! and God help you, monsieur, and you,
madame, sitting here in your _smuggled clothes_, to beat
upon the breast with me and cry, `I, too, Lord---I,
too, stood by and consented.' ''

  P<e`>re Jerome had not intended these for his closing
words; but just there, straight away before his sight
and almost at the farthest door, a man rose slowly from
his seat and regarded him steadily with a kind, bronzed,
sedate face, and the sermon, as if by a sign of command,
was ended. While the _Credo_ was being chanted
he was still there; but when, a moment after its
close, the eye of P<e`>re Jerome returned in that direction,
his place was empty.

  As the little priest, his labor done and his vestments
changed, was turning into the Rue Royale and leaving
the cathedral out of sight, he just had time to understand
that two women were purposely allowing him to
overtake them, when the one nearer him spoke in the
Creole _patois_, saying, with some timid haste:

  ``Good-morning, P<e`>re---P<e`>re Jerome; P<e`>re Jerome,
we thank the good God for that sermon.''

  ``Then, so do I,'' said the little man. They were
the same two that he had noticed when he was preaching.
The younger one bowed silently; she was a
beautiful figure, but the slight effort of P<e`>re Jerome's
kind eyes to see through the veil was vain. He would
presently have passed on, but the one who had spoken
before said :

  ``I thought you lived in the Rue des Ursulines.''

  ``Yes; I am going this way to see a sick person.''
The woman looked up at him with an expression of
mingled confidence and timidity.

  ``It must be a blessed thing to be so useful as to be
needed by the good God,'' she said.

  P<e`>re Jerome smiled:

  ``God does not need me to look after his sick; but
he allows me to do it, just as you let your little boy in
frocks carry in chips.'' He might have added that he
loved to do it, quite as much.

  It was plain the woman had somewhat to ask, and
was trying to get courage to ask it.

  ``You have a little boy?'' asked the priest.

  ``No, I have only my daughter;'' she indicated the
girl at her side. Then she began to say something
else, stopped, and with much nervousness asked:

  ``P<e`>re Jerome, what was the name of that man?''

  ``His name?'' said the priest. ``You  wish  to know
his name?''

  ``Yes, Monsieur'' (or _Mich<e'>_, as she spoke it); ``it
was such a beautiful story.'' The speaker's companion
looked another way.

  ``His name,'' said Father Jerome,---``some say
one name and some another. Some think it was Jean
Lafitte, the famous; you have heard of him? And do
you go to my church, Madame---?''

  ``No, Mich<e'>; not in the past; but from this time,
yes. My name''---she choked a little, and yet it
evidently gave her pleasure to offer this mark of confidence
---``is Madame Delphine---Delphine Carraze.''

                 CHAPTER VI.

             A CRY OF DISTRESS.

  P<e`>re Jerome's smile and exclamation, as some days
later he entered his parlor in response to the announcement
of a visitor, were indicative of hearty greeting
rather than surprise.

  ``Madame Delphine!''

  Yet surprise could hardly have been altogether absent,
for though another Sunday had not yet come
around, the slim, smallish figure sitting in a corner,
looking very much alone, and clad in dark attire,
which seemed to have been washed a trifle too often,
was Delphine Carraze on her second visit. And this,
he was confident, was over and above an attendance in
the confessional, where he was sure he had recognized
her voice.

  She rose bashfully and gave her hand, then looked
to the floor, and began a faltering speech, with a swallowing
motion in the throat, smiled weakly and commenced
again, speaking, as before, in a gentle, low
note, frequently lifting up and casting down her eyes,
while shadows of anxiety and smiles of apology chased
each other rapidly across her face. She was trying to
ask his advice.

  ``Sit down,'' said he; and when they had taken
seats she resumed, with downcast eyes:

  ``You know,---probably I should have said this in
the confessional, but''---

  ``No matter, Madame Delphine; I understand;
you did not want an oracle, perhaps; you want a
friend.''

  She lifted her eyes, shining with tears, and dropped
them again.

  ``I''---she ceased. ``I have done a''---she
dropped her head and shook it despondingly---``a
cruel thing.'' The tears rolled from her eyes as she
turned away her face.

  P<e`>re Jerome remained silent, and presently she
turned again, with the evident intention of speaking at
length.

  ``It began nineteen years ago---by''---her eyes,
which she had lifted, fell lower than ever, her brow
and neck were suffused with blushes, and she murmured
---``I fell in love.''

  She said no more, and by and by P<e`>re Jerome replied:

  ``Well, Madame Delphine, to love is the right of
every soul. I believe in love. If your love was pure
and lawful I am sure your angel guardian smiled upon
you; and if it was not, I cannot say you have nothing
to answer for, and yet I think God may have said:
`She is a quadroone; all the rights of her womanhood
trampled in the mire, sin made easy to her---
almost compulsory,---charge it to account of whom
it may concern.' ''

  ``No, no!'' said Madame Delphine, looking up
quickly, ``some of it might fall upon''--- Her eyes
fell, and she commenced biting her lips and nervously
pinching little folds in her skirt. ``He was good---as
good as the law would let him be---better, indeed, for
he left me property, which really the strict law does
not allow. He loved our little daughter very much. 
He wrote to his mother and sisters, owning all his
error and asking them to take the child and bring her
up. I sent her to them when he died, which was soon
after, and did not see my child for sixteen years. But
we wrote to each other all the time, and she loved
me. And then---at last''---Madame Delphine ceased
speaking, but went on diligently with her agitated fingers,
turning down foolish hems lengthwise of her lap.

  ``At last your mother-heart conquered,'' said P<e`>re
Jerome.

  She nodded.

  ``The sisters married, the mother died; I saw that
even where she was she did not escape the reproach
of her birth and blood, and when she asked me to let
her come''---The speaker's brimming eyes rose an 
instant. ``I know it was wicked, but---I said,
come.''

  The tears dripped through her hands upon her
dress.

  ``Was it she who was with you last Sunday?''

  ``Yes.''

  ``And now you do not know  what  to  do  with  her?''

  ``Ah! _c'est <c,>a oui!_---that is it.''

  ``Does she look like you, Madame Delphine?''

  ``Oh, thank God, no! you would never believe she
was my daughter; she is white and beautiful!''

  ``You thank God for that which is your main difficulty,
Madame Delphine.''

  ``Alas! yes.''

  P<e`>re Jerome laid his palms tightly across his knees
with his arms bowed out, and fixed his eyes upon the
ground, pondering.

  ``I suppose she is a sweet, good daughter?'' said
he, glancing at Madame Delphine, without changing
his attitude.

  Her answer was to raise her eyes rapturously.

  ``Which gives us the dilemma in its fullest force,''
said the priest, speaking as if to the floor. ``She has
no more place than if she had dropped upon a strange
planet.'' He suddenly looked up with a brightness
which almost as quickly passed away, and then he
looked down again. His happy thought was the cloister;
but he instantly said to himself : ``They cannot
have overlooked that choice, except intentionally---
which they have a right to do.'' He could do nothing
but shake his head.

  ``And suppose you should suddenly die,'' he said;
he wanted to get at once to the worst.

  The woman made a quick gesture, and buried her
head in her handkerchief, with the stiffed cry:

  ``Oh, Olive, my daughter!''

  ``Well, Madame Delphine,'' said P<e`>re Jerome, more
buoyantly, ``one thing is sure: we must find a way
out of this trouble.''

  ``Ah!'' she exclaimed, looking heavenward, ``if it
might be!''

  ``But it must be!'' said the priest.

  ``But---how shall it be?'' asked the desponding
woman.

  ``Ah!'' said P<e`>re Jerome, with a shrug, ``God
knows.''

  ``Yes,'' said the quadroone, with a quick sparkle in
her gentle eye; ``and I know, if God would tell anybody,
He would tell you!''

  The priest smiled and rose.

  ``Do you think so? Well, leave me to think of it.
I will ask Him.''

  ``And He will tell you!'' she replied. And He
will bless you!'' She rose and gave her hand. As
she withdrew it she smiled. ``I had such a strange
dream,'' she said, backing toward the door.

  ``Yes?''

  ``Yes. I got my troubles all mixed up with your
sermon. I dreamed I made that pirate the guardian
of my daughter.''

  P<e`>re Jerome smiled also, and shrugged.

  ``To you, Madame Delphine, as you are placed,
every white man in this country, on land or on water,
is a pirate, and of all pirates, I think that one is,
without doubt, the best.''

  ``Without doubt,'' echoed Madame Delphine, wearily,
still withdrawing backward. P<e`>re Jerome stepped
forward and opened the door.

  The shadow of some one approaching it from without
fell upon the threshold, and a man entered, dressed
in dark blue cottonade, lifting from his head a fine
Panama hat, and from a broad, smooth brow, fair
where the hat had covered it, and dark below, gently
stroking back his very soft, brown locks. Madame
Delphine slightly started aside, while P<e`>re Jerome
reached silently, but eagerly, forward, grasped a larger
hand than his own, and motioned its owner to a seat. 
Madame Delphine's eyes ventured no higher than to
discover that the shoes of the visitor were of white duck.

  ``Well, P<e`>re Jerome,'' she said, in a hurried undertone,
``I am just going to say Hail Marys all the time
till you find that out for me!''

  ``Well, I hope that will be soon, Madame Carraze. 
Good-day, Madame Carraze.''

  And as she departed, the priest turned to the newcomer
and extended both hands, saying, in the same
familiar dialect in which he had been addressing the
quadroone:

  ``Well-a-day, old playmate! After so many years!''

  They sat down side by side, like husband and wife,
the priest playing with the other's hand, and talked of
times and seasons past, often mentioning Evariste and
often Jean.

  Madame Delphine stopped short half-way home and
returned to P<e`>re Jerome's. His entry door was wide
open and the parlor door ajar. She passed through
the one and with downcast eyes was standing at the
other, her hand lifted to knock, when the door was
drawn open and the white duck shoes passed out. 
She saw, besides, this time the blue cottonade suit.

  ``Yes,'' the voice of P<e`>re Jerome was saying, as his
face appeared in the door---``Ah! Madame''---

  ``I lef' my para_sol_,'' said Madame Delphine, in
English.

  There was this quiet evidence of a defiant spirit
hidden somewhere down under her general timidity,
that, against a fierce conventional prohibition, she
wore a bonnet instead of the turban of her caste, and
carried a parasol.

  P<e`>re Jerome turned and brought it.

  He made a motion in the direction in which the late
visitor had disappeared.

  ``Madame Delphine, you saw dat man?''

  ``Not his face.''

  ``You couldn' billieve me iv I tell you w'at dat man
pur_pose_ to do!''

  ``Is dad so, P<e`>re Jerome?''

  ``He's goin' to hopen a bank!''

  ``Ah!'' said Madame Delphine, seeing she was expected
to be astonished.

  P<e`>re Jerome evidently longed to tell something that
was best kept secret; he repressed the impulse, but his
heart had to say something. He threw forward one
hand and looking pleasantly at Madame Delphine,
with his lips dropped apart, clenched his extended
hand and thrusting it toward the ground, said in a
solemn undertone:

  ``He is God's own banker, Madame Delphine.''


               CHAPTER VIII.

             MICH<E'> VIGNEVIELLE

Madame Delphine, sold one of the corner lots of
her  property. She  had  almost  no  revenue, and  now
and then a piece had to go. As  a  consequence  of  the
sale, she had a few large bank-notes sewed up in her
petticoat, and one day---maybe a fortnight after her
tearful interview with P<e`>re Jerome---she found it necessary
to get one of these changed into small money. 
She was in the Rue Toulouse, looking from one side to
the other for a bank which was not in that street at all,
when she noticed a small sign hanging above a door,
bearing the name ``Vignevielle.'' She looked in. 
P<e`>re Jerome had told her (when she had gone to him
to ask where she should apply for change) that if she
could only wait a few days, there would be a new
concern opened in Toulouse Street,---it really seemed
as if Vignevielle was the name, if she could judge; it
looked to be, and it was, a private banker's,---``U. L.
Vignevielle's,'' according to a larger inscription which
met her eyes as she ventured in. Behind the counter,
exchanging some last words with a busy-mannered man
outside, who, in withdrawing, seemed bent on running
over Madame Delphine, stood the man in blue cottonade,
whom she had met in P<e`>re Jerome's doorway. 
Now, for the first time, she saw his face, its strong,
grave, human kindness shining softly on each and
every bronzed feature. The recognition was mutual. 
He took pains to speak first, saying, in a re-assuring
tone, and in the language he had last heard her use:

  `` 'Ow I kin serve you, Madame?''

  ``Iv you pliz, to mague dad bill change, Mich<e'>.''

  She pulled from her pocket a wad of dark cotton
handkerchief, from which she began to untie the imprisoned
note. Madame Delphine had an uncommonly
sweet voice, and it seemed so to strike Monsieur
Vignevielle. He spoke to her once or twice more, as
he waited on her, each time in English, as though
he enjoyed the humble melody of its tone, and presently,
as she turned to go, he said:

  ``Madame Carraze!''

  She started a little, but bethought herself instantly
that he had heard her name in P<e`>re Jerome's parlor. 
The good father might even have said a few words about
her after her first departure; he had such an overflowing
heart. ``Madame Carraze,'' said Monsieur Vignevielle,
``doze kine of note wad you '_an_' me juz now is
bein' contrefit. You muz tek kyah from doze kine of
note. You see''---He drew from his cash-drawer a
note resembling the one he had just changed for her,
and proceeded to point out certain tests of genuineness.
The counterfeit, he said, was so and so.

  ``Bud,'' she exclaimed, with much dismay, ``dad
was de manner of my bill! Id muz be---led me see
dad bill wad I give you,---if you pliz, Mich<e'>.''

  Monsieur Vignevielle turned to engage in conversation
with an employ<e'> and a new visitor, and gave no sign of
hearing Madame Delphine's voice. She asked a second
time, with like result, lingered timidly, and as he turned
to give his attention to a third visitor, reiterated,

  ``Mich<e'> Vignevielle, I wizh you pliz led''---

  ``Madame Carraze,'' he said, turning so suddenly
as to make the frightened little woman start, but extending
his palm with a show of frankness, and assuming
a look of benignant patience, `` 'ow I kin fine doze
note now, mongs' all de rez? Iv you pliz nod to
mague me doze troub'.''

  The dimmest shadow of a smile seemed only to give
his words a more kindly authoritative import, and as he
turned away again with a manner suggestive of finality,
Madame Delphine found no choice but to depart. But
she went away loving the ground beneath the feet of
Monsieur U. L. Vignevielle.

  ``Oh, P<e`>re Jerome!'' she exclaimed in the corrupt
French of her caste, meeting the little father on the
street a few days later, ``you told the truth that day in
your parlor. _Mo conn<e'> li <a`> c't heure_. I know him
now; he is just what you called him.''

  ``Why do you not make him _your_ banker, also,
Madame Delphine?''

  ``I have done so this very day!'' she replied, with
more happiness in her eyes than P<e`>re Jerome had ever
before seen there.

  ``Madame Delphine,'' he said, his own eyes sparkling,
``make _him_ your daughter's guardian; for myself,
being a priest, it would not be best; but ask him; I
believe he will not refuse you.''

  Madame Delphine's face grew still brighter as he
spoke.

  ``It was in my mind,'' she said.

  Yet to the timorous Madame Delphine many trifles
became, one after another, an impediment to the making
of this proposal, and many weeks elapsed before further
delay was positively without excuse. But at length,
one day in May, 1822, in a small private office behind
Monsieur Vignevielle's banking-room,---he sitting beside
a table, and she, more timid and demure than
ever, having just taken a chair by the door,---she said,
trying, with a little bashful laugh, to make the matter
seem unimportant, and yet with some tremor of voice:

  ``Mich<e'> Vignevielle, I bin maguing my will.'' (Having
commenced their acquaintance in English, they
spoke nothing else.)

  `` 'Tis a good idy,'' responded the banker.

  ``I kin mague you de troub' to kib dad will fo' me,
Mich<e'> Vignevielle?''

  ``Yez.''

  She looked up with grateful re-assurance; but her
eyes dropped again as she said:

  ``Mich<e'> Vignevielle''---Here she choked, and began
her peculiar motion of laying folds in the skirt
of her dress, with trembling fingers. She lifted her
eyes, and as they met the look of deep and placid kindness
that was in his face, some courage returned, and
she said:

  ``Mich<e'>.''

  ``Wad you wand?'' asked he, gently.

  ``If it arrive to me to die''---

  ``Yez?''

  Her words were scarcely audible:

  ``I wand you teg kyah my lill' girl.''

  ``You 'ave one lill' gal, Madame Carraze?''

  She nodded with her face down.

  ``An' you godd some mo' chillen?''

  ``No.''

  ``I nevva know dad, Madame Carraze. She's a lill'
small gal?''

  Mothers forget their daughters' stature. Madame
Delphine said:

  ``Yez.''

  For a few moments neither spoke, and then Monsieur
Vignevielle said:

  ``I will do dad.''

  ``Lag she been you' h-own?'' asked the mother,
suffering from her own boldness.

  ``She's a good lill' chile, eh?''

  ``Mich<e'>, she's a lill' hangel!'' exclaimed Madame
Delphine, with a look of distress.

  ``Yez; I teg kyah 'v 'er, lag my h-own. I mague
you dad promise.''

  ``But''---There was something still in the way,
Madame Delphine seemed to think.

  The banker waited in silence.

  ``I suppose you will want to see my lill' girl?''

  He smiled; for she looked at him as if she would
implore him to decline.

  ``Oh, I tek you' word fo' hall dad, Madame Carraze. 
It mague no differend wad she loog lag; I don' wan'
see 'er.''

  Madame Delphine's parting smile---she went very
shortly---was gratitude beyond speech.

  Monsieur Vignevielle returned to the seat he had left,
and resumed a newspaper,---the _Louisiana Gazette_ in
all probability,---which he had laid down upon Madame
Delphine's entrance. His eyes fell upon a paragraph
which had previously escaped his notice. There
they rested. Either he read it over and over unwearyingly,
or he was lost in thought. Jean Thompson
entered.

  ``Now,''  said  Mr. Thompson, in  a  suppressed  tone,
bending a little across the table, and laying one palm
upon a package of papers which lay in the other, ``it
is completed. You could retire from your business
any day inside of six hours without loss to anybody.''
(Both here and elsewhere, let it be understood that
where good English is given the words were spoken in
good French.)

  Monsieur Vignevielle raised his eyes and extended
the newspaper to the attorney, who received it and
read the paragraph. Its substance was that a certain
vessel of the navy had returned from a cruise in the
Gulf of Mexico and Straits of Florida, where she had
done valuable service against the pirates---having, for
instance, destroyed in one fortnight in January last
twelve pirate vessels afloat, two on the stocks, and
three establishments ashore.

  ``United  States brig _Porpoise_,'' repeated Jean
Thompson. ``Do you know her?''

  ``We are acquainted,'' said Monsieur Vignevielle.


                CHAPTER VIII.

                    SHE.

  A quiet footstep, a grave new presence on financial
sidewalks, a neat garb slightly out of date, a gently
strong and kindly pensive face, a silent bow, a new
sign in the Rue Toulouse, a lone figure with a cane,
walking in meditation in the evening light under the
willows of Canal Marigny, a long-darkened window
re-lighted in the Rue Conti---these were all; a fall of
dew would scarce have been more quiet than was the
return of Ursin Lemaitre-Vignevielle to the precincts
of his birth and early life.

  But we hardly give the event its right name. It was
Capitaine Lemaitre who had disappeared; it was Monsieur
Vignevielle who had come back. The pleasures,
the haunts, the companions, that had once held out
their charms to the impetuous youth, offered no enticements
to Madame Delphine's banker. There is this
to be said even for the pride his grandfather had
taught him, that it had always hold him above low
indulgences; and though he had dallied with kings,
queens, and knaves through all the mazes of Faro,
Rondeau, and Craps, he had done it loftily; but now
he maintained a peaceful estrangement from all. Evariste
and Jean, themselves, found him only by seeking.

  ``It is the right way,'' he said to P<e`>re Jerome, the
day we saw him there. ``Ursin Lemaitre is dead. I
have buried him. He left a will. I am his executor.''

  ``He is crazy,'' said his lawyer brother-in-law, impatiently.
``On the contr-y,'' replied the little priest, `` 'e 'as
come ad hisse'f.''

  Evariste spoke.

  ``Look at his face, Jean. Men with that kind of
face are the last to go crazy.''

  ``You have not proved that,'' replied Jean, with an
attorney's obstinacy. ``You should have heard him
talk the other day about that newspaper paragraph.
`I have taken Ursin Lemaitre's head; I have it with
me; I claim the reward, but I desire to commute it to
citizenship.' He is crazy.''

  Of course Jean Thompson did not believe what he
said; but he said it, and, in his vexation, repeated it,
on the _banquettes_ and at the clubs; and presently it
took the shape of a sly rumor, that the returned rover
was a trifle snarled in his top-hamper.

  This whisper was helped into circulation by many
trivial eccentricities of manner, and by the unaccountable
oddness of some of his transactions in business.

  ``My dear sir!'' cried his astounded lawyer, one
day, ``you are not running a charitable institution!''

  ``How do you know?'' said Monsieur Vignevielle. 
There the conversation ceased.

  ``Why do you not found hospitals and asylums at
once,'' asked the attorney, at another time, with a
vexed laugh, ``and get the credit of it?''

  ``And make the end worse than the beginning,''
said the banker, with a gentle smile, turning away to a
desk of books.

  ``Bah!'' muttered Jean Thompson.

  Monsieur Vignevielle betrayed one very bad symptom.
Wherever he went he seemed looking for somebody.
It may have been perceptible only to those who
were sufficiently interested in him to study his movements;
but those who saw it once saw it always. He
never passed an open door or gate but he glanced in;
and often, where it stood but slightly ajar, you might
see him give it a gentle push with his hand or cane. 
It was very singular.

  He walked much alone after dark. The _guichinangoes_
(garroters, we might say), at those times the
city's particular terror by night, never crossed his
path. He was one of those men for whom danger
appears to stand aside.

  One beautiful summer night, when all nature seemed
hushed in ecstasy, the last blush gone that told of the
sun's parting, Monsieur Vignevielle, in the course
of one of those contemplative, uncompanioned walks
which it was his habit to take, came slowly along the
more open portion of the Rue Royale, with a step
which was soft without intention, occasionally touching
the end of his stout cane gently to the ground and
looking upward among his old acquaintances, the stars.

  It was one of those southern nights under whose
spell all the sterner energies of the mind cloak themselves
and lie down in bivouac, and the fancy and the
imagination, that cannot sleep, slip their fetters and
escape, beckoned away from behind every flowering
bush and sweet-smelling tree, and every stretch of
lonely, half-lighted walk, by the genius of poetry. 
The air stirred softly now and then, and was still
again, as if the breezes lifted their expectant pinions
and lowered them once more, awaiting the rising of
the moon in a silence which fell upon the fields, the
roads, the gardens, the walls, and the suburban and
half-suburban streets, like a pause in worship. And
anon she rose.

  Monsieur Vignevielle's steps were bent toward the
more central part of the town, and he was presently
passing along a high, close, board-fence, on the right-hand
side of the way, when, just within this enclosure,
and almost overhead, in the dark boughs of a large
orange-tree, a mocking-bird began the first low flute-notes
of his all-night song. It may have been only
the nearness of the songster that attracted the passer's
attention, but he paused and looked up.

  And then he remarked something more,---that the
air where he had stopped was filled with the overpowering
sweetness of the night-jasmine. He looked
around; it could only be inside the fence. There was
a gate just there. Would he push it, as his wont was?
The grass was growing about it in a thick turf, as
though the entrance had not been used for years. An
iron staple clasped the cross-bar, and was driven deep
into the gate-post. But now an eye that had been in
the blacksmithing business---an eye which had later
received high training as an eye for fastenings---fell
upon that staple, and saw at a glance that the wood
had shrunk from it, and it had sprung from its hold,
though without falling out. The strange habit asserted
itself; he laid his large hand upon the cross-bar; the
turf at the base yielded, and the tall gate was drawn
partly open.

  At that moment, as at the moment whenever he
drew or pushed a door or gate, or looked in at a window,
he was thinking of one, the image of whose face
and form had never left his inner vision since the day
it had met him in his life's path and turned him face
about from the way of destruction.

  The bird ceased. The cause of the interruption,
standing within the opening, saw before him, much
obscured by its own numerous shadows, a broad, ill-kept,
many-flowered garden, among whose untrimmed
rose-trees and tangled vines, and often, also, in its old
walks of pounded shell, the coco-grass and crab-grass
had spread riotously, and sturdy weeds stood up in
bloom. He stepped in and drew the gate to after him. 
There, very near by, was the clump of jasmine, whose
ravishing odor had tempted him. It stood just beyond
a brightly moonlit path, which turned from him in a
curve toward the residence, a little distance to the
right, and escaped the view at a point where it seemed
more than likely a door of the house might open upon
it. While he still looked, there fell upon his ear, from
around that curve, a light footstep on the broken shells
---one only, and then all was for a moment still again. 
Had he mistaken? No. The same soft click was repeated
nearer by, a pale glimpse of robes came through
the tangle, and then, plainly to view, appeared an outline
---a presence---a form---a spirit---a girl!

  From throat to instep she was as white as Cynthia. 
Something above the medium height, slender, lithe, her
abundant hair rolling in dark, rich waves back from
her brows and down from her crown, and falling in
two heavy plaits beyond her round, broadly girt waist
and full to her knees, a few escaping locks eddying
lightly on her graceful neck and her temples,---her
arms, half hid in a snowy mist of sleeve, let down to
guide her spotless skirts free from the dewy touch of
the grass,---straight down the path she came!

  Will she stop? Will she turn aside? Will she espy
the dark form in the deep shade of the orange, and,
with one piercing scream, wheel and vanish? She
draws near. She approaches the jasmine; she raises
her arms, the sleeves falling like a vapor down to the
shoulders; rises upon tiptoe, and plucks a spray. O
Memory! Can it be? _Can it be?_ Is this his quest, or
is it lunacy? The ground seems to Monsieur Vignevielle
the unsteady sea, and he to stand once  more  on
a deck. And she? As  she  is  now, if  she  but  turn
towards the orange, the whole glory of the moon will
shine upon her face. His heart stands still; he is
waiting for her to do that. She reaches up again; this
time a bunch for her mother. That neck and throat!
Now she fastens a spray in her hair. The mocking-bird
cannot withhold; he breaks into song---she turns
---she turns her face---it is she, it is she! Madame 
Delphine's daughter is the girl he met on the ship.


                 CHAPTER IX.

                   OLIVE.

  She was just passing seventeen---that beautiful
year when the heart of the maiden still beats quickly
with the surprise of her new dominion, while with gentle
dignity her brow accepts the holy coronation of
womanhood. The forehead and temples beneath her
loosely bound hair were fair without paleness, and
meek without languor. She had the soft, lack-lustre
beauty of the South; no ruddiness of coral, no waxen
white, no pink of shell; no heavenly blue in the
glance; but a face that seemed, in all its other
beauties, only a tender accompaniment for the large,
brown, melting eyes, where the openness of child-nature
mingled dreamily  with  the  sweet  mysteries of
maiden thought, We say no color of shell on face or
throat; but this was no deficiency, that which took its
place being the warm, transparent tint of sculptured
ivory.

  This side doorway which led from Madame Delphine's
house into her garden was over-arched partly
by an old remnant of vine-covered lattice, and partly
by a crape-myrtle, against whose small, polished trunk
leaned a rustic seat. Here Madame Delphine and
Olive loved to sit when the twilights were balmy or the
moon was bright.

  ``Ch<e'>rie,'' said Madame Delphine on one of those
evenings, ``why do you dream so much?''

  She spoke in the _patois_ most natural to her, and
which her daughter had easily learned.

  The girl turned her face to her mother, and smiled,
then dropped her glance to the hands in her own lap,
which were listlessly handling the end of a ribbon.
The mother looked at her with fond solicitude. Her
dress was white again; this was but one night since
that in which Monsieur Vignevielle had seen her at the
bush of night-jasmine. He had not been discovered,
but had gone away, shutting the gate, and leaving it
as he had found it.

  Her head was uncovered. Its plaited masses, quite
black in the moonlight, hung down and coiled upon
the bench, by her side. Her chaste drapery was of
that revived classic order which the world of fashion
was again laying aside to re-assume the medi<ae>val
bondage of the staylace; for New Orleans was behind
the fashionable world, and Madame Delphine and her
daughter were behind New Orleans. A delicate scarf,
pale blue, of lightly netted worsted, fell from either
shoulder down beside her hands. The look that was
bent upon her changed perforce to one of gentle admiration.
She seemed the goddess of the garden.

  Olive glanced up. Madame Delphine was not prepared
for the movement, and on that account repeated
her question:

  ``What are you thinking about?''

  The dreamer took the hand that was laid upon hers
between her own palms, bowed her bead, and gave
them a soft kiss.

  The mother submitted. Wherefore, in the silence
which followed, a daughter's conscience felt the burden
of having withheld an answer, and Olive presently
said, as the pair sat looking up into the sky:

  ``I was thinking of P<e`>re Jerome's sermon.''

  Madame Delphine had feared so. Olive had lived on
it ever since the day it was preached. The poor mother
was almost ready to repent having ever afforded her
the opportunity of hearing it. Meat and drink had
become of secondary value to her daughter; she fed
upon the sermon.

  Olive felt her mother's thought and knew that her
mother knew her own; but now that she had confessed,
she would ask a question:

  ``Do you think, _maman,_ that P<e`>re Jerome knows
it was I who gave that missal?''

  ``No,'' said Madame Delphine, ``I am sure he does
not.''

  Another question came more timidly:

  ``Do---do you think he knows _him?_''

  ``Yes, I do. He said in his sermon he did.''

  Both remained for a long time very still, watching
the moon gliding in and through among the small dark-and-white
clouds. At last the daughter spoke again.

  ``I wish I was P<e`>re---I wish I was as good as P<e`>re
Jerome.''

  ``My child,'' said Madame Delphine, her tone betraying
a painful summoning of strength to say what
she had lacked the courage to utter,---``my child, I
pray the good God you will not let your heart go after
one whom you may never see in this world!''

  The maiden turned her glance, and their eyes met. 
She cast her arms about her mother's neck, laid her
cheek upon it for a moment, and then, feeling the maternal
tear, lifted her lips, and, kissing her, said:

  ``I will not! I will not!''

  But the voice was one, not of willing consent, but
of desperate resolution.

  ``It would be useless, anyhow,'' said the mother,
laying her arm around her daughter's waist.

  Olive repeated the kiss, prolonging it passionately.

  ``I have nobody but you,'' murmured the girl; ``I
am a poor quadroone!''

  She threw back her plaited hair for a third embrace,
when a sound in the shrubbery startled them.

  ``_Qui ci <c,>a?_'' called Madame Delphine, in a frightened
voice, as the two stood up, holding to each
other.

  No answer.

  ``It was only the dropping of a twig,'' she whispered,
after a long holding of the breath. But they
went into the house and barred it everywhere.

  It was no longer pleasant to sit up. They retired,
and in course of time, but not soon, they fell asleep,
holding each other very tight, and fearing, even in
their dreams, to hear another twig fall.



                 CHAPTER X.

                   BIRDS.

  Monsieur Vignevielle looked in at no more doors
or windows; but if the disappearance of this symptom
was a favorable sign, others came to notice which
were especially bad,---for instance, wakefulness. At
well-nigh any hour of the night, the city guard, which
itself dared not patrol singly, would meet him on his
slow, unmolested, sky-gazing walk.

  ``Seems to enjoy it,'' said Jean Thompson; ``the
worst sort of evidence. If he showed distress of
mind, it would not be so bad; but his calmness,---
ugly feature.''

  The attorney had held his ground so long that he
began really to believe it was tenable.

  By day, it is true, Monsieur Vignevielle was at his
post in his quiet ``bank.'' Yet here, day by day, he
was the source of more and more vivid astonishment
to those who held preconceived notions of a banker's
calling. As a banker, at least, he was certainly out
of balance; while as a promenader, it seemed to those
who watched him that his ruling idea had now veered
about, and that of late he was ever on the quiet alert,
not to find, but to evade, somebody.

  ``Olive, my child,'' whispered Madame Delphine
one morning, as the pair were kneeling side by side on
the tiled floor of the church, ``yonder is Mich<e'> Vignevielle!
If you will only look at once---he is just
passing a little in--- Ah, much too slow again; he
stepped out by the side door.''

  The mother thought it a strange providence that
Monsieur Vignevielle should always be disappearing
whenever Olive was with her.

  One early dawn, Madame Delphine, with a small
empty basket on her arm, stepped out upon the _banquette_
in front of her house, shut and fastened the
door very softly, and stole out in the direction whence
you could faintly catch, in the stillness of the daybreak,
the songs of the Gascon butchers and the
pounding of their meat-axes on the stalls of the distant
market-house. She was going to see if she could
find some birds for Olive,---the child's appetite was
so poor; and, as she was out, she would drop an early
prayer at the cathedral. Faith and works.

  ``One must venture something, sometimes, in the
cause of religion,'' thought she, as she started timorously
on her way. But she had not gone a dozen steps
before she repented her temerity. There was some
one behind her.

  There should not be any thing terrible in a footstep
merely because it is masculine; but Madame Delphine's
mind was not prepared to consider that. A
terrible secret was haunting her. Yesterday morning
she had found a shoe-track in the garden. She had
not disclosed the discovery to Olive, but she had hardly
closed her eyes the whole night.

  The step behind her now might be the fall of that
very shoe. She quickened her pace, but did not leave
the sound behind. She hurried forward almost at a
run; yet it was still there---no farther, no nearer. 
Two frights were upon her at once---one for herself,
another for Olive, left alone in the house; but she had
but the one prayer---``God protect my child!'' After
a fearful time she reached a place of safety, the cathedral.
There, panting, she knelt long enough to know
the pursuit was, at least, suspended, and then arose,
hoping and praying all the saints that she might find
the way clear for her return in all haste to Olive.

  She approached a different door from that by which
she had entered, her eyes in all directions and her
heart in her throat.

  ``Madame Carraze.''

  She started wildly and almost screamed, though the
voice was soft and mild. Monsieur Vignevielle came
slowly forward from the shade of the wall. They
met beside a bench, upon which she dropped her
basket.

  ``Ah, Mich<e'> Vignevielle, I thang de good God to
mid you!''

  ``Is dad so, Madame Carraze? Fo' w'y dad is?''

  ``A man was chase me all dad way since my 'ouse!''

  ``Yes, Madame, I sawed him.''

  ``You sawed 'im? Oo it was?''

  `` 'Twas only one man wad is a foolizh. De people
say he's crezzie. _Mais,_ he don' goin' to meg you no
'arm.''

  ``But I was scare' fo' my lill' girl.''

  ``Noboddie don' goin' trouble you' lill' gal, Madame
Carraze.''

  Madame Delphine looked up into the speaker's
strangely kind and patient eyes, and drew sweet reassurance
from them.

  ``Madame,'' said Monsieur Vignevielle, ``wad pud
you hout so hearly dis morning?''

  She told him her errand. She asked if he thought
she would find any thing.

  ``Yez,'' he said, ``it was possible---a few lill' _b<e'>cassines-de-mer,_
ou somezin' ligue. But fo' w'y you lill'
gal lose doze hapetide?''

  ``A-h, Mich<e'>,''---Madame Delphine might have tried
a thousand times again without ever succeeding half
so well in lifting the curtain upon the whole, sweet,
tender, old, old-fashioned truth,---``Ah, Mich<e'>, she
wone tell me!''

  ``Bud, anny'ow, Madame, wad you thing?''

  ``Mich<e'>,'' she replied, looking up again with a tear
standing in either eye, and then lookin, down once
more as she began to speak, ``I thing---I thing she's
lonesome.''

  ``You thing?''

  She nodded.

  ``Ah! Madame Carraze,''  he  said, partly  extending,
his hand, ``you see? 'Tis impossible to mague you'
owze shud so tighd to priv-en dad. Madame, I med
one mizteg.''

  ``Ah, _non_, Mich<e'>!''

  ``Yez. There har nod one poss'bil'ty fo' me to be
dad guardian of you' daughteh!''

  Madame Delphine started with surprise and alarm.

  ``There is ondly one wad can be,'' he continued.

  ``But oo, Mich<e'>?''

  ``God.''

  ``Ah, Mich<e'> Vignevielle''---She looked at him
appealingly.

  ``I don' goin' to dizzerd you, Madame Carraze,''
he said.

  She lifted her eyes. They filled. She shook her
head, a tear fell, she bit her lip, smiled, and suddenly
dropped her face into both hands, sat down upon the
bench and wept until she shook.

  ``You dunno wad I mean, Madame Carraze?''

  She did not know.

  ``I mean dad guardian of you' daughteh godd to
fine 'er now one 'uzban'; an' noboddie are hable to
do dad egceb de good God 'imsev. But, Madame,
I tell you wad I do.''

  She rose up. He continued:

  ``Go h-open you' owze; I fin' you' daughteh dad
'uzban'.''

  Madame Delphine was a helpless, timid thing; but
her eyes showed she was about to resent this offer. 
Monsieur Vignevielle put forth his hand---it touched
her shoulder---and said, kindly still, and without
eagerness:

  ``One w'ite man, Madame: 'tis prattycabble. I
_know_ 'tis prattycabble. One w'ite jantleman, Madame. 
You can truz me. I goin' fedge 'im. H-ondly you
go h-open you' owze.''

  Madame Delphine looked down, twining her handkerchief
among her fingers.

  He repeated his proposition.

  ``You will come firz by you'se'f?'' she asked.

  ``Iv you wand.''

  She lifted up once more her eye of faith. That was
her answer.

  ``Come,'' he said, gently, ``I wan' sen' some bird
ad you' lill' gal.''

  And they went away, Madame Delphine's spirit
grown so exaltedly bold that she said as they went,
though a violent blush followed her words:

  ``Mich<e'> Vignevielle, I thing P<e`>re Jerome mighd be
ab'e to tell you someboddie.''


                 CHAPTER XI.

                FACE TO FACE.

  Madame Delphine found her house neither burned
nor rifled.

  ``_Ah! ma piti sans popa!_  Ah! my little  fatherless
one!'' Her faded bonnet fell back between her
shoulders, hanging on by the strings, and her dropped
basket, with its ``few lill' _b<e'>cassines-de-mer_'' dangling
from the handle, rolled out its okra and soup-joint
upon the floor. ``_Ma piti!_ kiss!---kiss!---kiss!''

  ``But is it good news you have, or bad?'' cried the
girl, a fourth or fifth time.

  ``_Dieu sait, ma c<e`>re; mo pas conn<e'>l!_''---God knows,
my darling; I cannot tell!''

  The mother dropped into a chair, covered her face
with her apron, and burst into tears, then looked up
with an effort to smile, and wept afresh.

  ``What have you been doing?'' asked the daughter,
in a long-drawn, fondling tone. She leaned forward
and unfastened her mother's bonnet-strings. ``Why
do you cry?''

  ``For nothing at all, my darling; for  nothing---I
am such a fool.''

  The  girl's  eyes  filled. The  mother  looked  up into
her face and said:

  ``No, it is nothing, nothing, only that turning
her  head  from  side  to  side  with a slow, emotional
emphasis, ``Mich<e'>' Vignevielle is the best---_best_ man
on the good Lord's earth!''

  Olive drew a chair close to her mother, sat down
and took the little yellow hands into her own white
lap, and looked tenderly into her eyes. Madame Delphine
felt herself yielding; she must make a show of
telling something:

  ``He sent you those birds!''

  The girl drew her face back a little. The little
woman turned away, trying in vain to hide her tearful
smile, and they laughed together, Olive mingling a
daughter's fond kiss with her laughter.

  ``There is something else,'' she said, ``and you
shall tell me.''

  ``Yes,'' replied Madame Delphine, ``only let me
get composed.''

  But she did not get so. Later in the morning she
came to Olive with the timid yet startling proposal
that they would do what they could to brighten up the
long-neglected front room. Olive was mystified and
troubled, but consented, and thereupon the mother's
spirits rose.

  The work began, and presently ensued all the thumping,
the trundling, the lifting and letting down, the
raising and swallowing of dust, and the smells of turpentine,
brass, pumice and woollen rags that go to
characterize a housekeeper's _<e'>meute_; and still, as the
work progressed, Madame Delphine's heart grew light,
and her little black eyes sparkled.

  ``We like a clean parlor, my daughter, even though
no one is ever coming to see us, eh?'' she, said, as
entering the apartment she at last sat down, late in
the afternoon. She had put on her best attire.

  Olive was not there to reply. The mother called
but got no answer. She rose with an uneasy heart,
and met her a few steps beyond the door that opened
into the garden, in a path which came up from an old
latticed bower. Olive was approaching slowly, her
face pale and wild. There was an agony of hostile
dismay in the look, and the trembling and appealing
tone with which, taking the frightened mother's cheeks
between her palms, she said:

  ``_Ah! ma m<e`>re, qui vini 'ci ce soir?_''---Who is
coming here this evening?

  ``Why, my dear child, I was just saying, we like a
clean''---

  But the daughter was desperate:

  ``Oh, tell me, my mother, who is coming?''

  ``My darling, it is our blessed friend, Mich<e'> Vignevielle!''

  ``To see me?'' cried the girl.

  ``Yes.''

  ``Oh, my mother, what have you done?''

  ``Why, Olive, my child,'' exclaimed the little mother,
bursting into tears, ``do you forget it is Mich<e'> Vignevielle
who has promised to protect you when I die?''

  The daughter had turned away, and entered the
door; but she faced around again, and extending her
arms toward her mother, cried:

  ``How can---he is a white man---I am a poor''---

  ``Ah! _ch<e'>rie_,'' replied Madame Delphine, seizing
the outstretched hands, ``it is there---it is there that
he shows himself the best man alive! He sees that
difficulty; he proposes to meet it; he'says he will find
you a suitor!''

  Olive freed her hands violently, motioned her mother
back, and stood proudly drawn up, flashing an indignation
too great for speech; but the next moment she
had uttered a cry, and was sobbing on the floor.

  The mother knelt beside her and threw an arm about
her shoulders.

  ``Oh, my sweet daughter, you must not cry! I did
not want to tell you at all! I did not want to tell
you! It isn't fair for you to cry so hard. Mich<e'>
Vignevielle says you shall have the one you wish, or
none at all, Olive, or none at all.''

  ``None at all! none at all! None, none, none!''

  ``No, no, Olive,'' said the mother, ``none at all. 
He brings none with him tonight, and shall bring none
with him hereafter.''

  Olive rose suddenly, silently declined her mother's
aid, and went alone to their chamber in the half-story.

		<*>

  Madame Delphine wandered drearily from door to
window, from window to door, and presently into the
newly-furnished front room which now seemed dismal
beyond degree. There was a great Argand lamp in
one corner. How she had labored that day to prepare
it for evening illumination! A little beyond it, on the
wall, hung a crucifix. She knelt under it, with her
eyes fixed upon it, and thus silently remained until its
outline was indistinguishable in the deepening shadows
of evening.

  She arose. A few minutes later, as she was trying
to light the lamp, an approaching step on the sidewalk
seemed to pause. Her heart stood still. She softly
laid the phosphorus-box out of her hands. A shoe
grated softly on the stone step, and Madame Delphine,
her heart beating in great thuds, without waiting for a
knock, opened the door, bowed low, and exclaimed in
a soft perturbed voice :

  ``Mich<e'> Vignevielle!''

  He entered, hat in hand, and with that almost noiseless
tread which we have noticed. She gave him a
chair and closed the door; then hastened, with words
of apology, back to her task of lighting the lamp. 
But her hands paused in their work again,---Olive's
step was on the stairs; then it came off the stairs;
then it was in the next room, and then there was the
whisper of soft robes, a breath of gentle perfume, and
a snowy figure in the door. She was dressed for the
evening.

  ``Maman?''

  Madame Delphine was struggling desperately with
the lamp, and at that moment it responded with a tiny
bead of light.

  ``I am here, my daughter.''

  She hastened to the door, and Olive, all unaware of
a third presence, lifted her white arms, laid them about
her mother's neck, and, ignoring her effort to speak,
wrested a fervent kiss from her lips. The crystal of
the lamp sent out a faint gleam; it grew; it spread on
every side; the ceiling, the walls lighted up; the crucifix,
the furniture of the room came back into shape.

  ``Maman!'' cried Olive, with a tremor of consternation.

  ``It is Mich<e'> Vignevielle, my daughter''---

  The gloom melted swiftly away before the eyes of
the startled maiden, a dark form stood out against the
farther wall, and the light, expanding to the full, shone
clearly upon the unmoving figure and quiet face of
Capitaine Lemaitre.


                CHAPTER XII.

              THE MOTHER BIRD.

  One afternoon, some three weeks after Capitaine
Lemaitre had called on Madame Delphine, the priest
started to make a pastoral call and had hardly left the
gate of his cottage, when a person, overtaking him,
plucked his gown:

  ``P<e`>re Jerome''---

  He turned.

  The face that met his was so changed with excitement
and distress that for an instant he did not recognize
it.

  ``Why, Madame Delphine''---

  ``Oh, P<e`>re Jerome! I wan' see you so bad, so
bad! _Mo oul<e'> dit qui<c,>'ose_,---I godd some' to tell
you.''

 The two languages might be more successful than
one, she seemed to think.

  ``We had better go back to my parlor,'' said the
priest, in their native tongue.

  They returned.

  Madame Delphine's very step was altered,---nervous
and inelastic. She swung one arm as she walked,
and brandished a turkey-tail fan.

  ``I was glad, yass, to kedge you,'' she said, as
they mounted the front, outdoor stair; following her
speech with a slight, unmusical laugh, and fanning
herself with unconscious fury.

  ``_F<e'> chaud_,'' she remarked again, taking the chair
he offered and continuing to ply the fan.

  P<e`>re Jerome laid his hat upon a chest of drawers,
sat down opposite her, and said, as he wiped his kindly
face :

  ``Well, Madame Carraze?''

  Gentle as the tone was, she started, ceased fanning,
lowered the fan to her knee, and commenced smoothing
its feathers.

  ``P<e`>re Jerome''---She gnawed her lip and shook
her head.

  ``Well?''

  She burst into tears.

  The priest rose and loosed the curtain of one of the
windows. He did it slowly---as slowly as he could,
and, as he came back, she lifted her face with sudden
energy, and exclaimed':

  ``Oh, P<e`>re Jerome, de law is brogue! de law is
brogue! I brogue it! 'Twas me! 'Twas me!''

  The tears gushed out again, but she shut her lips
very tight, and durably turned away her face. P<e`>re
Jerome waited a little before replying; then he said,
very gently:

  ``I suppose dad muss 'ave been by accyden', Madame
Delphine?''

  The little father felt a wish---one which he often
had when weeping women were before him---that he
were an angel instead of a man, long enough to press
the tearful cheek upon his breast, and assure the
weeper God would not let the lawyers and judges hurt
her. He allowed a few moments more to pass, and
then asked:

  ``_N'est-ce-pas_, Madame  Delphine? Daz ze way,
ain't it?''

  ``No, P<e`>re Jerome, no. My daughter---oh, P<e`>re
Jerome, I bethroath my lill' girl---to a w'ite man!''

  And immediately Madame Delphine commenced savagely
drawing a thread in the fabric of her skirt with
one trembling hand, while she drove the fan with the
other. ``Dey goin' git marry.''

  On the priest's face came a look of pained surprise.
He slowly said:

  ``Is dad possib', Madame Delphine?''

  ``Yass,'' she replied, at first without lifting her
eyes; and then again, ``Yass,'' looking full upon him
through her tears, ``yaas, 'tis tru'---''

  He rose and walked once across the room, returned,
and said, in the Creole dialect:

  ``Is he a good man---without doubt?''

  ``De bez in God's world!'' replied Madame Delphine,
with a rapturous smile.

  ``My poor, dear friend,'' said the priest, ``I am
afraid you are being deceived by somebody.''

  There was the pride of an unswerving faith in the
triumphant tone and smile with which she replied,
raising and slowly shaking her head:

  ``Ah-h, no-o-o, Mich<e'>! Ah-h, no, no! Not by
Ursin Lemaitre-Vignevielle!''

  P<e`>re Jerome was confounded. He turned again,
and, with his hands at his back and his eyes cast
down, slowly paced the floor.

  ``He _is_ a good man,'' he said, by and by, as if he
thought aloud. At length he halted before the woman.

  ``Madame Delphine''---

  The distressed glance with which she had been following
his steps was lifted to his eyes.

  ``Suppose dad should be true w'at doze peop' say
'bout Ursin.''

  ``_Qui ci <c,>a?_ What is that?'' asked the quadroone,
stopping her fan.

  ``Some peop' say Ursin is crezzie.''

  ``Ah, P<e`>re Jerome!'' She leaped to her feet as if
he had smitten her, and putting his words away with
an outstretched arm and wide-open palm, suddenly
lifted hands and eyes to heaven, and cried: ``I wizh
to God---_I wizh to God_---de whole worl' was crezzie
dad same way!'' She sank, trembling, into her chair.

  ``Oh, no, no,'' she continued, shaking her head, `` 'tis
not Mich<e'> Vignevielle w'at's crezzie.'' Her eyes
lighted with sudden fierceness. `` 'Tis dad _law_! Dad
_law_ is crezzie! Dad law is a fool!''

  A priest of less heart-wisdom might have replied
that the law is---the law; but P<e`>re Jerome saw that
Madame Delphine was expecting this very response. 
Wherefore he said, with gentleness:

  ``Madame Delphine, a priest is not a bailiff, but a
physician. How can I help you?''

  A grateful light shone a moment in her eyes, yet
there remained a piteous hostility in the tone in which
she demanded:

  ``_Mais, pou'quoi y<e'> f<e'> cette m<e'>chanique l<a`>?_''---What
business had they to make that contraption?

  His answer was a shrug with his palms extended
and a short, disclamatory ``Ah.'' He started to resume
his walk, but turned to her again and said:

  ``Why did they make that law? Well, they made
it to keep the two races separate.''

  Madame Delphine startled the speaker with a loud,
harsh, angry laugh. Fire came from her eyes and her
lip curled with scorn.

  ``Then they made a lie, P<e`>re Jerome! Separate!
No-o-o! They do not want to keep us separated; no,
no! But they _do_ want to keep us despised!'' She
laid her hand on her heart, and frowned upward with
physical pain. ``But, very well! from which race do
they want to keep my daughter separate? She is seven
parts white! The law did not stop her from being
that; and now, when she wants to be a white man's
good and honest wife, shall that law stop her? Oh,
no!'' She rose up. ``No; I will tell you what that
law is made for. It is made to---punish---my---child
---for---not---choosing---her---father! P<e`>re Jerome
---my God, what a law!''  She  dropped  back  into  her
seat. The tears came in  a  flood, which  she  made  no
attempt to restrain.

  ``No,'' she began again---and here she broke into
English---``fo' me I don' kyare; but, P<e`>re Jerome,
---'tis fo' dat I came to tell you,---dey _shall not_ punizh
my daughter!'' She was on her feet again, smiting
her heaving bosom with the fan. ``She shall
marrie oo she want!''
	
  P<e`>re Jerome had heard her out, not interrupting by
so much as a motion of the hand. Now his decision
was made, and he touched her softly with the ends of
his fingers.

  ``Madame Delphine, I want you to go at 'ome. 
Go at 'ome.''

  ``Wad you goin' mague?'' she asked.

  ``Nottin'. But go at 'ome. Kip quite; don' put
you'se'f sig. I goin' see Ursin. We trah to figs dat
law fo' you.''

  ``You kin figs dad!'' she cried, with a gleam of
joy.

  ``We goin' to try, Madame Delphine. Adieu!''

  He offered his band. She seized and kissed it
thrice, covering it with tears, at the same time lifting
up her eyes to his and murmuring:

  ``De bez man God evva mague!''

  At the door she turned to offer a more conventional
good-by; but he was following her out, bareheaded. 
At the gate they paused an instant, and then parted
with a simple adieu, she going home and he returning
for his hat, and starting again upon his interrupted
business.

		<*>

  Before he came back to his own house, he stopped
at the lodgings of Monsieur Vignevielle, but did not
find him in.

  ``Indeed,'' the servant  at  the  door  said, ``he  said
he might not return for some days or weeks.''

  So P<e`>re Jerome, much wondering, made a second
detour toward the residence of one of Monsieur Vignevielle's
employ<e'>s.

  ``Yes,'' said the clerk, ``his instructions are to hold
the business, as far as practicable, in suspense, during
his absence. Every thing is in another name.'' And
then he whispered:

  ``Officers of the Government looking for him. Information
got from some of the prisoners taken months
ago by the United States brig _Porpoise_. But a
still softer whisper---``have no fear; they will  never
find him: Jean Thompson and Evariste Varrillat have
hid him away too well for that.''


                CHAPTER XIII.

                TRIBULATION.

  The Saturday following was a very beautiful day. 
In the morning a light fall of rain had passed across
the town, and all the afternoon you could see signs,
here and there upon the horizon, of other showers. 
The ground was dry again, while the breeze was cool
and sweet, smelling of wet foliage and bringing sunshine
and shade in frequent and very pleasing alternation.

  There was a walk in P<e`>re Jerome's little garden, of
which we have not spoken, off on the right side of the
cottage, with his chamber window at one end, a few
old and twisted, but blossom-laden, crape-myrtles on
either hand, now and then a rose of some unpretending
variety and some bunches of rue, and at the other end
a shrine, in whose blue niche stood a small figure of
Mary, with folded hands and uplifted eyes. No other
window looked down upon the spot, and its seclusion
was often a great comfort to P<e`>re Jerome.

  Up and down this path, but a few steps in its entire
length, the priest was walking, taking, the air for a few
moments after a prolonged sitting in the confessional. 
Penitents had been numerous this afternoon. He was
thinking of Ursin. The officers of the Government
had not found him, nor had P<e`>re Jerome seen him;
yet he believed they had, in a certain indirect way,
devised a simple project by which they could at any
time ``figs dad law,'' providing only that these Government
officials would give over their search; for,
though he had not seen the fugitive, Madame Delphine
had seen him, and had been the vehicle of communication
between them. There was an orange-tree, where
a mocking-bird was wont to sing, and a girl in white to
walk, that the detectives wot not of. The law was to
be ``figs'' by the departure of the three frequenters
of the jasmine-scented garden in one ship to France,
where the law offered no obstacles.

  It seemed moderately certain to those in search of
Monsieur Vignevielle (and it was true) that Jean and
Evariste were his harborers; but for all that the hunt,
even for clews, was vain. The little banking establishment
had not been disturbed. Jean Thompson
had told the searchers certain facts about it, and about
its gentle proprietor as well, that persuaded them to
make no move against the concern, if the same relations
did not even induce a relaxation of their efforts
for his personal discovery.

  P<e`>re Jerome was walking to and fro, with his hands
behind him, pondering these matters. He had paused
a moment at the end of the walk farthest from his window,
and was looking around upon the sky, when, turning,
he beheld a closely veiled female figure standing
at the other end, and knew instantly that it was Olive. 

  She came forward quickly and with evident eagerness. 

  ``I came to confession,'' she said, breathing hurriedly,
the excitement in her eyes shining through her
veil, ``but I find I am too late.''

  ``There is no too late or too early for that; I am
always ready,'' said the priest. ``But how is your
mother?''

  ``Ah!''---

  Her voice  failed.

  ``More trouble?''

  ``Ah, sir, I have _made_ trouble. Oh, P<e`>re Jerome,
I am bringing so much trouble upon my poor mother!''

  P<e`>re Jerome moved slowly toward the house, with
his eyes cast down, the veiled girl at his side.

  ``It is not your fault,'' he presently said. And
after another pause: ``I thought it was all arranged.''

  He looked up and could see, even through the veil,
her crimson blush.

  ``Oh, no,'' she replied, in a low, despairing voice,
dropping her face.

  ``What is the difficulty?'' asked the priest, stopping
in the angle of the path, where it turned toward the
front of the house.

  She averted her face, and began picking the thin
scales of bark from a crape-myrtle.

  ``Madame Thompson and her husband were at our
house this morning. _He_ had told Monsieur Thompson
all about it. They were very kind to me at first, but
they tried''---She was weeping.

  ``What did they try to do?'' asked the priest

  ``They tried to make me believe he is insane.''

  She succeeded in passing her handkerchief up under
her veil.

  ``And I suppose then your poor mother grew angry,
eh?''

  ``Yes; and they became much more so, and said if
we did not write, or send a writing, to _him_, within
twenty-four hours, breaking the''---

  ``Engagement,'' said P<e'>re Jerome.

  ``They would give him up to the Government. Oh,
P<e`>re Jerome, what shall I do? It is killing my
mother!''

  She bowed her head and sobbed.

  ``Where is your mother now?''

  ``She has gone to see Monsieur Jean Thompson. 
She says she has a plan that will match them all. I
do not know what it is. I begged her not to go; but
oh, sir, _she_ is crazy,---and I am no better.''

  ``My poor child,'' said P<e`>re Jerome, ``what you
seem to want is not absolution, but relief from persecution.''

  ``Oh, father, I have committed mortal sin,---I am
guilty of pride and anger.''

  ``Nevertheless,'' said the priest, starting toward his
front gate, ``we will put off your confession. Let it
go until to-morrow morning; you will find me in my
box just before mass; I will hear you then. My child,
I know that in your heart, now, you begrudge the time
it would take; and that is right. There are moments
when we are not in place even on penitential knees,
It is so with you now. We must find your mother. 
Go you at once to your house; if she is there, comfort
her as best you can, and _keep her in, if possible,_ until
I come. If she is not there, stay; leave me to find
her; one of you, at least, must be where I can get
word to you promptly. God comfort and uphold you. 
I hope you may find her at home; tell her, for me, not
to fear,''---he lifted the gate-latch,---``that she and
her daughter are of more value than many sparrows;
that God's priest sends her that word from Him. Tell
her to fix her trust in the great Husband of the Church,
and she shall yet see her child receiving the grace-giving
sacrament of matrimony. Go; I shall, in a
few minutes, be on my way to Jean Thompson's, and
shall find her, either there or wherever she is. Go;
they shall not oppress you. Adieu!''

  A moment or two later he was in the street himself.


                CHAPTER XIV.

                 BY AN OATH.

  P<e'>re Jerome, pausing on a street-corner in the  last
hour of sunlight, had wiped his brow and taken his
cane down from under his arm to start again, when
somebody, coming noiselessly from he knew not where,
asked, so suddenly as to startle him:

  ``Mich<e'>, commin y<e'> pell<e'> la rie ici?---how do they
call this street here?''

  It was by the bonnet and dress, disordered though
they were, rather than by the haggard face which
looked distractedly around, that he recognized the
woman to whom he replied in her own _patois_:

  ``It is the Rue Burgundy. Where are you going,
Madame Delphine?''

  She almost leaped from the ground.

  ``Oh, P<e`>re Jerome! _mo pas conn<e'>_,---I dunno. You
know were's dad 'ouse of Mich<e'> Jean Tomkin? _Mo
courri 'ci, mo courri l<a`>,---mo pas capabe li trouv<e'>. I go
(run) here---there---I cannot find it,'' she gesticulated.

  ``I am going there myself,'' said he; ``but why do
you want to see Jean Thompson, Madame Delphine?''

  ``I '_blige_' to see 'im!'' she replied, jerking herself
half around away, one foot planted forward with all
air of excited preoccupation; ``I godd some' to tell
'im wad I '_blige_' to tell 'im!''

  ``Madame Delphine''---

  ``Oh! P<e`>re Jerome, fo' de love of de good God,
show me dad way to de 'ouse of Jean Tomkin!''

  Her distressed smile implored pardon for her rudeness.

  ``What are you going, to tell him?'' asked the priest. 

  ``Oh, P<e'>re Jerome,''---in the Creole _patois_ again,
---I am going to put an end to all this trouble---only
I pray you do not ask me about it now; every minute
is precious!''

  He could not withstand her look of entreaty.

  ``Come,'' he said, and they went.

			<*>

  Jean  Thompson  and  Doctor Varrillat lived opposite
each other on the Bayou road, a little way beyond the
town limits as then prescribed. Each had his large,
white-columned, four-sided house among the magnolias,
---his huge live-oak overshadowing either corner of the
darkly shaded garden, his broad, brick walk leading
down to the tall, brick-pillared gate, his square of
bright, red pavement on the turf-covered sidewalk, and
his railed platform spanning the draining-ditch, with a
pair of green benches, one on each edge, facing each
other crosswise of the gutter. There, any sunset hour,
you were sure to find the householder sitting beside his
cool-robed matron, two or three slave nurses in white
turbans standing at hand, and an excited throng of
fair children, nearly all of a size.

  Sometimes, at a beckon or call, the parents on one
side of the way would join those on the other, and the
children and nurses of both families would be given the
liberty of the opposite platform and an ice-cream fund!
Generally the parents chose the Thompson platform,
its outlook being more toward the sunset.

  Such happened to be the arrangement this afternoon. 
The two husbands sat on one bench and their wives on
the other, both pairs very quiet, waiting respectfully
for the day to die, and exchanging only occasional
comments on matters of light moment as they passed
through the memory. During one term of silence
Madame Varrillat, a pale, thin-faced, but cheerful-looking,
lady, touched Madame Thompson, a person of
two and a half times her weight, on her extensive and
snowy bare elbow, directing her attention obliquely up
and across the road.

  About a hundred yards distant, in the direction of
the river, was a long, pleasantly shaded green strip
of turf, destined in time for a sidewalk. It had a deep
ditch on the nearer side, and a fence of rough cypress
palisades on the farther, and these were overhung, on
the one hand, by a row of bitter-orange-trees inside the
enclosure, and, on the other, by a line of slanting
china-trees along the outer edge of the ditch. Down
this cool avenue two figures were approaching side by
side. They had first attracted Madame Varrillat's
notice by the bright play of sunbeams which, as they
walked, fell upon them in soft, golden flashes through
the chinks between the palisades.

  Madame Thompson elevated a pair of glasses which
were no detraction from her very good looks, and remarked,
with the serenity of a reconnoitring general:

  ``_P<e`>re Jerome et cette milatraise._''

  All eyes were bent toward them.

  ``She walks like a man,'' said Madame Varrillat, in
the language with which the conversation had opened.

  ``No,'' said the physician, ``like a woman in a state
of high nervous excitement.''

  Jean Thompson kept his eyes on the woman, and said:

  ``She must not forget to walk  like a woman in the
State of Louisiana,''---as near as the pun can be
translated. The company laughed. Jean Thompson
looked at his wife, whose applause he prized, and she
answered by an asseverative toss of the head, leaning
back and contriving with some effort, to get her arms
folded. Her laugh was musical and low, but enough
to make the folded arms shake gently up and down.

  ``P<e`>re Jerome is talking to her,'' said one. The
priest was at that moment endeavoring, in the interest
of peace, to say a good word for the four people who
sat watching his approach. It was in the old strain:

  ``Blame them one part, Madame Delphine, and their
fathers, mothers, brothers, and fellow-citizens the other
ninety-nine.''

  But to every thing she had the one amiable answer
which P<e'>re Jerome ignored:

  ``I am going to arrange it to satisfy everybody, all
together. _Tout <a`> fait._''

  ``They are coming here,'' said Madame Varrillat,
half articulately.

  ``Well, of course,'' murmured another; and the
four rose up, smiling courteously, the doctor and attorney
advancing and shaking hands with the priest.

  No---P<e`>re Jerome thanked them---he could not sit
down.

  ``This, I believe you know, Jean, is Madame Delphine''---

  The quadroone courtesied.

  ``A friend of mine,'' he added, smiling kindly upon
her, and turning, with something imperative in his eye,
to the group. ``She says she has an important private
matter to communicate.''

  ``To me?'' asked Jean Thompson.

  ``To all of you; so I will--- Good-evening.''  He
responded nothing to the expressions of regret, but
turned to Madame Delphine. She murmured something.

  ``Ah! yes, certainly.'' He addressed the company:
``She wishes me to speak for her veracity; it is unimpeachable.
Well, good-evening.'' He shook hands
and departed.

  The four resumed their seats, and turned their eyes
upon the standing figure.

  ``Have you something to say to us?'' asked Jean
Thompson, frowning at her law-defying bonnet.

  ``Oui,'' replied the woman, shrinking to one side,
and laying hold of one of the benches, ``_mo oul<e'> di'
tou' <c,>'ose_''---I want to tell every thing. ``_Mich<e'>
Vignevielle la plis bon homme di moune_''---the best
man in the world; ``_mo pas capabe li f<e'> tracas_''---
I cannot give him trouble. ``_Mo pas capabe, non;
m'ol<e'> di' tous <c,>'ose._'' She attempted to fan herself,
her face turned away from the attorney, and her
eyes rested on the ground.

  ``Take a seat,'' said Doctor Varrillat, with some
suddenness, starting from his place and gently guiding
her sinking form into the corner of the bench. The
ladies rose up; somebody had to stand; the two races
could not both sit down at once---at least not in that
public manner.

  ``Your salts,'' said the physician to his wife. She
handed the vial. Madame Delphine stood up again.

  ``We will all go inside,'' said Madame Thompson,
and they passed through the gate and up the walk,
mounted the steps, and entered the deep, cool drawing-room.

  Madame  Thompson  herself  bade the quadroone be
seated.

  ``Well?'' said Jean Thompson, as the rest took
chairs.

  ``_C'est drole_''---it's funny---said Madame Delphine,
with a piteous effort to smile, ``that nobody
thought of it. It is so plain. You have only to look
and see. I mean about Olive.'' She loosed a button
in the front of her dress and passed her hand into her
bosom. ``And yet, Olive herself never thought of it. 
She does not know a word.''

  The hand came out holding a miniature. Madame
Varrillat passed it to Jean Thompson.

  ``_Ouala so popa_,'' said Madame Delphine. ``That
is her father.''

  It went from one to another, exciting admiration
and murmured praise.

  ``She is the image of him,'' said Madame Thompson,
in an austere undertone, returning it to her husband.

  Doctor Varrillat was watching Madame Delphine. 
She was very pale. She had passed a trembling hand
into a pocket of her skirt, and now drew out another
picture, in a case the counterpart of the first. He
reached out for it, and she handed it to him. He
looked at it a moment, when his eyes suddenly lighted
up and he passed it to the attorney.

  ``_Et l<a`>_''---Madame Delphine's utterance failed---
_et l<a`> ouala sa moman_. That is her mother.''

  The  three  others  instantly  gathered around Jean
Thompson's chair. They were much impressed.

  ``It  is  true  beyond a doubt!'' muttered Madame
Thompson.

  Madame Varrillat looked at her with astonishment.

  ``The  proof  is  right  there  in  the faces,'' said
Madame Thompson.

  ``Yes! yes!'' said Madame Delphine, excitedly;
``the proof is there! You do not want any better!
I am willing to swear to it! But you want no better
proof! That is all anybody could want! My God!
you cannot help but see it!''

  Her manner was wild.

  Jean Thompson looked at her sternly.

  ``Nevertheless you say you are willing to take your
solemn oath to this.''

  ``Certainly''---

  ``You will have to do it.''

  ``Certainly, Mich<e'> Thompson, _of course_ I  shall;  you
will make out the paper and I will swear before God
that it is true! Only''---turning to the ladies---``do
not tell Olive; she will never believe it. It will break
her heart! It''--

  A servant came and spoke privately to Madame
Thompson, who rose quickly and went to the hall. 
Madame Delphine continued, rising unconsciously:

  ``You see, I have had her with me from a baby. 
She knows no better. He brought her to me only two
months old. Her mother had died in the ship, coming
out here. He did not come straight from home here. 
His people never knew he was married!''

  The speaker looked around suddenly with a startled
glance. There was a noise of excited speaking in the
hall.

  ``It is not true, Madame Thompson!'' cried a
girl's voice.

  Madame Delphine's look became one of wildest
distress and alarm, and she opened her lips in a vain
attempt to utter some request, when Olive appeared a
moment in the door, and then flew into her arms.

  ``My mother! my mother! my mother!''

  Madame Thompson, with tears in her eyes, tenderly
drew them apart and let Madame Delphine down into
her chair, while Olive threw herself upon her knees,
continuing to cry:

  ``Oh, my mother! Say you are my mother!''

  Madame Delphine looked an instant into the upturned
face, and then turned her own away, with a
long, low cry of pain, looked again, and laying both
hands upon the suppliant's head, said:

  ``_Oh, ch<e`>re piti <a`> moin, to pa' ma fie!''---Oh, my
darling little one, you are not my daughter!---Her
eyes closed, and her head sank back; the two gentlemen
sprang to her assistance, and laid her upon a sofa
unconscious.

  When they  brought  her  to  herself, Olive  was  kneeling
at her head silently weeping.

  ``_Maman, ch<e`>re maman_!'' said  the  girl softly,
kissing her lips.

  ``_Ma courri c'ez moin_''---I will go home---said  the
mother, drearily.

  ``You will go home with me,'' said Madame
Varrillat, with great kindness of manner---``just
across the stree there; I will take care of you till you
feel better. And Olive will stay here with Madame
Thompson. You will be only the width of the street
apart.''

  But Madame Delphine would go nowhere but to
her home. Olive she would not allow to go with her.
Then they wanted to send a servant or two to sleep in
the house with her for aid and protection; but all she
would accept was the transient service of a messenger
to invite two of her kinspeople---man and wife---to
come and make their dwelling with her.

  In course of time these two---a poor, timid, helpless
pair---fell heir to the premises. Their children
had it after them; but, whether in those hands or
these, the house had its habits and continued in them;
and to this day the neighbors, as has already been
said, rightly explain its close-sealed, uninhabited look
by the all-sufficient statement that the inmates ``is
quadroons.''


                 CHAPTER XV.

               KYRIE ELEISON.

  The second Saturday afternoon following was hot
and calm. The lamp burning before the tabernacle in
P<e`>re Jerome's little church might have hung with as
motionless a flame in the window behind. The lilies
of St. Joseph's wand, shining in one of the half
opened panes, were not more completely at rest than
the leaves on tree and vine without, suspended in the
slumbering air. Almost as still, down under the
organ-gallery, with a single band of light falling
athwart his box from a small door which stood ajar,
sat the little priest, behind the lattice of the confessional,
silently wiping away the sweat that beaded on
his brow and rolled down his face. At distant intervals
the shadow of some one entering softly through
the door would obscure, for a moment, the band of
light, and an aged crone, or a little boy, or some gentle
presence that the listening confessor had known
only by the voice for many years, would kneel a few
moments beside his waiting ear, in prayer for blessing
and in review of those slips and errors which prove us
all akin .

  The day had been long and fatiguing. First, early
mass; a hasty meal; then a business call upon the
archbishop in the interest of some projected charity;
then back to his cottage, and so to the banking-house
of ``Vignevielle,'' in the Rue Toulouse. There all
was open, bright, and re-assured, its master virtually,
though not actually, present. The search was over
and the seekers gone, personally wiser than they would
tell, and officially reporting that (to the best of their
knowledge and belief, based on evidence, and especially
on the assurances of an unexceptionable eye-witness,
to wit, Monsieur Vignevielle, banker) Capitaine Lemaitre
was dead and buried. At noon there had been
a wedding in the little church. Its scenes lingered before
P<e`>re Jerome's vision now---the kneeling pair:
the bridegroom, rich in all the excellences of man,
strength and kindness slumbering interlocked in every
part and feature; the bride, a saintly weariness on her
pale face, her awesome eyes lifted in adoration upon
the image of the Saviour; the small knots of friends
behind: Madame Thompson, large, fair, self-contained;
Jean Thompson, with the affidavit of Madame Delphine
showing through his tightly buttoned coat; the physician
and his wife, sharing one expression of amiable
consent; and last---yet first---one small, shrinking
female figure, here at one side, in faded robes and
dingy bonnet. She sat as motionless as stone, yet
wore a look of apprehension, and in the small, restless
black eyes which peered out from the pinched and
wasted face, betrayed the peacelessness of a harrowed
mind; and neither the recollection of bride, nor of
groom, nor of potential friends behind, nor the occupation
of the present hour, could shut out from the
tired priest the image of that woman, or the sound of
his own low words of invitation to her, given as the
company left the church---``Come to confession this
afternoon.''

  By and by a long time passed without the approach
of any step, or any glancing of light or shadow, save
for the occasional progress from station to station of
some one over on the right who was noiselessly going
the way of the cross. Yet P<e`>re Jerome tarried.

  ``She will surely come,'' he said to himself; ``she
promised she would come.''

  A moment later, his sense, quickened by the prolonged
silence, caught a subtle evidence or two of
approach, and the next moment a penitent knelt noiselessly
at the window of his box, and the whisper came
tremblingly, in the voice he had waited to hear:
``_B<e'>nissez-moin, mo' P<e`>re, pa'ce que mo pech<e'>._''
(Bless me, father, for I have sinned.)

  He gave his blessing.

  ``_Ainsi soit-il_---Amen,'' murmured the penitent,
and then, in the soft accents of the Creole _patois_, continued:

  `` `I confess to Almighty God, to the blessed Mary,
ever Virgin, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to
blessed John the Baptist, to the holy Apostles Peter
and Paul, and to all the saints, that I have sinned
exceedingly in thought, word, and deed, _through my
fault, through my fault, through my most grievous
fault._' I confessed on Saturday, three weeks ago,
and received absolution, and I have performed the
penance  enjoined. Since  then''--- There she
stopped.

  There was a soft stir, as if she sank slowly down,
and another as if she rose up again, and in a moment
she said:

  ``Olive _is_ my child. The picture I showed to Jean
Thompson is the half-sister of my daughter's father,
dead before my child was born. She is the image of
her and of him; but, O God! Thou knowest! Oh,
Olive, my own daughter!''

  She ceased, and was still. P<e`>re Jerome waited, but
no sound came. He looked through the window. 
She was kneeling, with her forehead resting on her
arms---motionless.

  He repeated the words of absolution. Still she did
not stir.

  ``My daughter,'' he said, ``go to thy home in
peace.'' But she did not move.

  He rose hastily, stepped from the box, raised her in
his arms, and called her by name:

  ``Madame Delphine!'' Her head fell  back  in  his
elbow; for an instant there was life in the eyes---it
glimmered---it vanished, and tears gushed from his
own and fell upon the gentle face of the dead, as he
looked up to heaven and cried:

  ``Lord, lay not this sin to her charge!''
