              JEAN-AH POQUELIN.




  In the first decade of the present century, when the
newly established American Government was the most
hateful thing in Louisiana---when the Creoles were
still kicking at such vile innovations as the trial by
jury, American dances, anti-smuggling laws, and the
printing of the Governor's proclamation in English---
when the Anglo-American flood that was presently to
burst in a crevasse of immigration upon the delta had
thus far been felt only as slippery seepage which made
the Creole tremble for his footing---there stood, a
short distance above what is now Canal Street, and
considerably back from the line of villas which fringed
the river-bank on Tchoupitoulas Road, an old colonial
plantation-house half in ruin.

  It stood aloof from civilization, the tracts that had
once been its indigo fields given over to their first noxious
wildness, and grown up into one of the horridest
marshes within a circuit of fifty miles.

  The house was of heavy cypress, lifted up on pillars,
grim, solid, and spiritless, its massive build a
strong reminder of days still earlier, when every man
had been his own peace officer and the insurrection of
the blacks a daily contingency. Its dark, weather-beaten
roof and sides were hoisted up above the jungly
plain in a distracted way, like a gigantic ammunition-wagon
stuck in the mud and abandoned by some
retreating army. Around it was a dense growth of
low water willows, with half a hundred sorts of thorny
or fetid bushes, savage strangers alike to the ``language
of flowers'' and to the botanist's Greek. They
were hung with countless strands of discolored and
prickly smilax, and the impassable mud below bristled
with _chevaux de frise_ of the dwarf palmetto. Two lone
forest-trees, dead cypresses, stood in the centre of the
marsh, dotted with roosting vultures. The shallow
strips of water were hid by myriads of aquatic plants,
under whose coarse and spiritless flowers, could one
have seen it, was a harbor of reptiles, great and small,
to make one shudder to the end of his days.

  The house was on a slightly raised spot, the levee
of a draining canal. The waters of this canal did not
run; they crawled, and were full of big, ravening fish
and alligators, that held it against all comers.

  Such was the home of old Jean Marie Poquelin, once
an opulent indigo planter, standing high in the esteem
of his small, proud circle of exclusively male acquaintances
in the old city; now a hermit, alike shunned by
and shunning all who had ever known him. ``The
last of his line,'' said the gossips. His father lies
under the floor of the St. Louis Cathedral, with the
wife of his youth on one side, and the wife of his old
age on the other. Old Jean visits the spot daily. His
half-brother---alas! there was a mystery; no one
knew what had become of the gentle, young half-brother,
more than thirty years his junior, whom once
he seemed so fondly to love, but who, seven years ago,
had disappeared suddenly, once for all, and left no
clew of his fate.

  They had seemed to live so happily in each other's
love. No father, mother, wife to either, no kindred
upon earth. The elder a bold, frank, impetuous, chivalric
adventurer; the younger a gentle, studious, book-loving
recluse; they lived upon the ancestral estate
like mated birds, one always on the wing, the other
always in the nest.

  There was no trait in Jean Marie Poquelin, said the
old gossips, for which he was so well known among his
few friends as his apparent fondness for his ``little
brother.'' ``Jacques said this,'' and ``Jacques said
that;'' he ``would leave this or that, or any thing to
Jacques,'' for ``Jacques was a scholar,'' and ``Jacques
was good,'' or ``wise,'' or ``just,'' or ``far-sighted,''
as the nature of the case required;' and ``he should
ask Jacques as soon as he got home,'' since Jacques
was never elsewhere to be seen.

  It was between the roving character of the one
brother, and the bookishness of the other, that the
estate fell into decay. Jean Marie, generous gentleman,
gambled the slaves away one by one, until none
was left, man or woman, but one old African mute.

  The indigo-fields and vats of Louisiana had been
generally abandoned as unremunerative. Certain enterprising
men had substituted the culture of sugar;
but while the recluse was too apathetic to take so
active a course, the other saw larger, and, at that
time, equally respectable profits, first in smuggling,
and later in the African slave-trade. What harm
could he see in it? The whole people said it was
vitally necessary, and to minister to a vital public
necessity,---good enough, certainly, and so he laid up
many a doubloon, that made him none the worse in the
public regard.

  One day old Jean Marie was about to start upon a
voyage that was to be longer, much longer, than any
that he had yet made. Jacques had begged him hard
for many days not to go, but he laughed him off, and
finally said, kissing him:

  ``_Adieu, 'tit fr<e`>re._''

  ``No,'' said Jacques, ``I shall go with you.''

  They left the old hulk of a house in the sole care of
the African mute, and went away to the Guinea coast
together.

  Two years after, old Poquelin came home without
his vessel. He must have arrived at his house by
night. No one saw him come. No one saw ``his little
brother;'' rumor whispered that he, too, had returned,
but he had never been seen again.

  A dark suspicion fell upon the old slave-trader. No
patter that the few kept the many reminded of the
tenderness that had ever marked his bearing to the
missing man. The many shook their heads. ``You
know he has a quick and fearful temper;'' and ``why
does he cover his loss with mystery?'' ``Grief would
out with the truth.''

  ``But,'' said the charitable few, look in his face;
see that expression of true humanity.'' The many did
look in his face, and, as he looked in theirs, he read
the silent question: ``Where is thy brother Abel?''
The few were silenced, his former friends died off, and
the name of Jean Marie Poquelin became a symbol of
witchery, devilish crime, and hideous nursery fictions.

  The man and his house were alike shunned. The
snipe and duck hunters forsook the marsh, and the wood-cutters
abandoned the canal. Sometimes the hardier
boys who ventured out there snake-shooting heard
a slow thumping of oar-locks on the canal. They
would look at each other for a moment half in consternation,
half in glee, then rush from their sport in
wanton haste to assail with their gibes the unoffending,
withered old man who, in rusty attire, sat in the
stern of a skiff, rowed homeward by his white-headed
African mute.

  ``O Jean-ah Poquelin! O Jean-ah! Jean-ah Poquelin!''

  It was not necessary to utter more than that. No
hint of wickedness, deformity, or any physical or moral
demerit; merely the name and tone of mockery: ``Oh,
Jean-ah Poquelin!'' and while they tumbled one over
another in their needless haste to fly, he would rise
carefully from his seat, while the aged mute, with
downcast face, went on rowing, and rolling up his
brown fist and extending it toward the urchins, would
pour forth such an unholy broadside of French imprecation
and invective as would all but craze them with
delight.

  Among both blacks and whites the house was the
object of a thousand superstitions. Every midnight,
they affirmed, the _feu follet_ came out of the marsh and
ran in and out of the rooms, flashing from window to
window. The story of some lads, whose words in ordinary
statements was worthless, was generally credited,
that the night they camped in the woods, rather
than pass the place after dark, they saw, about sunset,
every window blood-red, and on each of the four chimneys
an owl sitting, which turned his head three times
round, and moaned and laughed with a human voice. 
There was a bottomless well, everybody professed to
know, beneath the sill of the big front door under the
rotten veranda; whoever set his foot upon that threshold
disappeared forever in the depth below.

  What wonder the marsh grew as wild as Africa!
Take all the Faubourg Ste. Marie, and half the ancient
city, you would not find one graceless dare-devil reckless
enough to pass within a hundred yards of the
house after nightfall.

			<*>

  The alien races pouring into old New Orleans began
to find the few streets named for the Bourbon princes
too strait for them. The wheel of fortune, beginning
to whirl, threw them off beyond the ancient corporation
lines, and sowed civilization and even trade
upon the lands of the Graviers and Girods. Fields
became roads, roads streets. Everywhere the leveller
was peering through his glass, rodsmen were whacking
their way through willow-brakes and rose-hedges, and
the sweating Irishmen tossed the blue clay up with
their long-handled shovels.

  ``Ha! that is all very well,'' quoth the Jean-Baptistes,
feeling the reproach of an enterprise that asked neither
cooperation nor advice of them, ``but wait till they
come yonder to Jean Poquelin's marsh; ha! ha! ha!''
The supposed predicament so delighted them, that they
put on a mock terror and whirled about in an assumed
stampede, then caught their clasped hands between
their knees in excess of mirth, and laughed till the
tears ran; for whether the street-makers mired in the
marsh, or contrived to cut through old ``Jean-ah's''
property, either event would be joyful. Meantime a
line of tiny rods, with bits of white paper in their split
tops, gradually extended its way straight through the
haunted ground, and across the canal diagonally.

  ``We shall fill that ditch,'' said the men in mud-boots,
and brushed close along the chained and padlocked
gate of the haunted mansion. Ah, Jean-ah
Poquelin, those were not Creole boys, to be stampeded
with a little hard swearing.

  He went to the Governor. That official scanned the
odd figure with no slight interest. Jean Poquelin was
of short, broad frame, with a bronzed leonine face. 
His brow was ample and deeply furrowed. His eye,
large and black, was bold and open like that of a
war-horse, and his jaws shut together with the firmness
of iron. He was dressed in a suit of Attakapas
cottonade, and his shirt unbuttoned and thrown back
from the throat and bosom, sailor-wise, showed a herculean
breast, hard and grizzled. There was no fierceness
or defiance in his look, no harsh ungentleness,
no symptom of his unlawful life or violent temper; but
rather a peaceful and peaceable fearlessness. Across
the whole face, not marked in one or another feature,
but as it were laid softly upon the countenance like an
almost imperceptible veil, was the imprint of some
great grief. A careless eye might easily overlook
it, but, once seen, there it hung---faint, but unmistakable.

  The Governor bowed.

  ``_Parlez-vous fran<c,>ais?_'' asked the figure.

  ``I would rather talk English, if you can do so,''
said the Governor.

  ``My name, Jean Poquelin.''

  ``How can I serve you, Mr. Poquelin?''

  ``My 'ouse is yond'; _dans le marais l<a`>-bas._''

  The Governor bowed.

  ``Dat _marais_ billong to me.''

  ``Yes, sir.''

  ``To me; Jean Poquelin; I hown 'im meself.''

  ``Well, sir?''

  ``He don't billong to you; I get him from me
father.''

  ``That is perfectly true, Mr. Poquelin, as far as I
am aware.''

  ``You want to make strit pass yond'?''

  ``I do not know, sir; it is quite probable; but the
city will indemnity you for any loss you may suffer---
you will get paid, you understand.''

  ``Strit can't pass dare.''

  ``You will have to see the municipal authorities
about that, Mr. Poquelin.''

  A bitter smile came upon the old man's face:

  ``_Pardon, Monsieur_, you is not _le Gouverneur?_''

  ``Yes.''

  ``_Mais,_ yes. You har _le Gouverneur_---yes. Veh-well.
I come to you. I tell you, strit can't pass at
me 'ouse.''

  ``But you will have to see''---

  ``I come to you. You is _le Gouverneur._  I know
not the new laws. I ham a Fr-r-rench-a-man!
Fr-rench-a-man have something _aller au contraire_---
he come at his _Gouverneur._  I come at you. If me not
had been bought from me king like _bossals_ in the hold
time, ze king gof---France would-a-show _Monsieur le
Gouverneur_ to take care his men to make strit in right
places. _Mais,_ I know; we billong to _Monsieur le
Pr<e'>sident._  I want you do somesin for me, eh?''

  ``What is it?'' asked the patient Governor.

  ``I want you tell _Monsieur le Pr<e'>sident,_ strit---
can't---pass---at---me---'ouse.''

  ``Have a chair, Mr. Poquelin;'' but the old man
did not stir. The Governor took a quill and wrote a
line to a city official, introducing Mr. Poquelin, and
asking for him every possible courtesy. He handed it
to him, instructing him where to present it.

  ``Mr. Poquelin,'' he said, with a conciliatory smile,
``tell me, is it your house that our Creole citizens tell
such odd stories about?''

  The old man glared sternly upon the speaker, and
with immovable features said:

  ``You don't see me trade some Guinea nigga'?''

  ``Oh, no.''

  ``You don't see me make some smugglin'?''

  ``No, sir; not at all.''

  ``But, I am Jean Marie Poquelin. I mine me hown
bizniss. Dat all right? Adieu.''

  He put his hat on and withdrew. By and by he
stood, letter in hand, before the person to whom it was
addressed. This person employed an interpreter.

  ``He says,'' said the interpreter to the officer, ``he
come to make you the fair warning how you muz not
make the street pas' at his 'ouse.''

  The officer remarked that ``such impudence was refreshing;''
but the experienced interpreter translated
freely.

  ``He says: `Why you don't want?' '' said the 
interpreter.

  The old slave-trader answered at some length.

  ``He says,'' said the interpreter, again turning to
the officer, ``the marass is a too unhealth' for peopl'
to live.''

  ``But we expect to drain his old marsh; it's not
going to be a marsh.''

  ``_Il dit_''---The interpreter explained in French.

  The old man answered tersely.

  ``He says the canal is a private,'' said the interpreter.

  ``Oh! _that_ old ditch; that's to be filled up. Tell
the old man we're going to fix him up nicely.''

  Translation being duly made, the man in power was
amused to see a thunder-cloud gathering on the old
man's face.

  ``Tell him,'' he added, ``by the time we finish,
there'll not be a ghost left in his shanty.''

  The interpreter began to translate, but---

  ``_J' com-prends, J' comprends,_''said the old man,
with an impatient gesture, and burst forth, pouring
curses upon the United States, the President, the Territory
of Orleans, Congress, the Governor and all his
subordinates, striding out of the apartment as he
cursed, while the object of his maledictions roared
with merriment and rammed the floor with his foot.

  ``Why, it will make his old place worth ten dollars
to one,'' said the official to the interpreter.

  ``'Tis not for de worse of de property,'' said the
interpreter.

  ``I should guess not,'' said the other, whittling his
chair,---``seems to me as if some of these old Creoles
would liever live in a crawfish hole than to have a
neighbor.''

  ``You know what make old Jean Poquelin make
like that? I will tell you. You know''---

  The interpreter was rolling a cigarette, and paused
to light his tinder; then, as the smoke poured in a
thick double stream from his nostrils, he said, in a
solemn whisper:

  ``He is a witch.''

  ``Ho, ho, ho!'' laughed the other.

  ``You don't believe it? What you want to bet?''
cried the interpreter, jerking himself half up and
thrusting out one arm while he bared it of its coat-sleeve
with the hand of the other. ``What you want
to bet?''

  ``How do you know?'' asked the official.

  ``Dass what I goin' to tell you. You know, one
evening I was shooting some _grosbec._  I killed three;
but I had trouble to fine them, it was becoming so
dark. When I have them I start' to come home;
then I got to pas' at Jean Poquelin's house.''

  ``Ho, ho, ho!'' laughed the other, throwing his leg
over the arm of his chair.

  ``Wait,'' said the interpreter. ``I come along slow
not making some noises; still, still''---

  ``And scared,'' said the smiling one.

  ``_Mais,_ wait. I get all pas' the 'ouse. `Ah!' I
say; `all right!' Then I see two thing' before!
Hah! I get as cold and humide, and shake like a leaf. 
You think it was nothing? There I see, so plain as
can be (though it was making nearly dark), I see Jean
---Marie---Po-que-lin walkin' right in front, and right
there beside of him was something like a man---but
not a man---white like paint!---I dropp' on the grass
from scared---they pass' ; so sure as I live 'twas the
ghos' of Jacques Poquelin, his brother!''

  ``Pooh!'' said the listener.

  ``I'll put my han' in the fire,'' said the interpreter.

  ``But did you never think,'' asked the other,
``that that might be Jack Poquelin, as you call him,
alive and well, and for some cause hid away by his
brother?''

  ``But there har' no cause!'' said the other, and the
entrance of third parties changed the subject.

  Some months passed and the street was opened. A
canal was first dug through the marsh, the small one
which passed so close to Jean Poquelin's house was
filled, and the street, or rather a sunny road, just
touched a corner of the old mansion's dooryard. The
morass ran dry. Its venomous denizens slipped away
through the bulrushes; the cattle roaming freely upon
its hardened surface trampled the superabundant undergrowth.
The bellowing frogs croaked to westward. 
Lilies and the flower-de-luce sprang up in the place of
reeds; smilax and poison-oak gave way to the purple-plumed
iron-weed and pink spiderwort; the bindweeds
ran everywhere blooming as they ran, and on one of
the dead cypresses a giant creeper hung its green
burden of foliage and lifted its scarlet trumpets. 
Sparrows and red-birds flitted through the bushes, and
dewberries grew ripe beneath. Over all these came a
sweet, dry smell of salubrity which the place had not
known sinee the sediments of the Mississippi first
lifted it from the sea.

  But its owner did not build. Over the willow-brakes,
and down the vista of the open street, bright
new houses, some singly, some by ranks, were prying
in upon the old man's privacy. They even settled
down toward his southern side. First a wood-cutter's
hut or two, then a market gardener's shanty, then
a painted cottage, and all at once the faubourg had
flanked and half surrounded him and his dried-up
marsh.

  Ah! then the common people began to hate him.
``The old tyrant!'' ``You don't mean an old
_tyrant_?'' ``Well, then, why don't he build when
the public need demands it? What does he live in
that unneighborly way  for?'' ``The old pirate!''
``The old kidnapper!'' How easily even the most
ultra Louisianians put on the imported virtues of the
North when they could be brought to bear against the
hermit, ``There he goes, with the boys after him!
Ah! ha! ha! Jean-ah Poquelin! Ah! Jean-ah!
Aha! aha! Jean-ah Marie! Jean-ah Poquelin! The
old villain!'' How merrily the swarming Am<e'>ricains
echo the spirit of persecution! ``The old fraud,''
they say---``pretends to live in a haunted house, does
he? We'll tar and feather him some day. Guess we
can fix him.''

  He cannot be rowed home along the old canal now;
he walks. He has broken sadly of late, and the
street urchins are ever at his heels. It is like the
days when they cried: ``Go up, thou bald-head,'' and
the old man now and then turns and delivers ineffectual
curses.

  To the Creoles---to the incoming lower class of superstitious
Germans, Irish, Sicilians, and others---he
became an omen and embodiment of public and private
ill-fortune. Upon him all the vagaries of their
superstitions gathered and grew. If a house caught
fire, it was imputed to his machinations. Did a woman
go off in a fit, he had bewitched her. Did a
child stray off for an hour, the mother shivered with
the apprehension that Jean Poquelin had offered him
to strange gods. The house was the subject of every
bad boy's invention who loved to contrive ghostly lies.
``As long as that house stands we shall have bad luck. 
Do you not see our pease and beans dying, our cabbages
and lettuce going to seed and our gardens turning
to dust, while every day you can see it raining in
the woods? The rain will never pass old Poquelin's
house. He keeps a fetich. He has conjured the
whole Faubourg St. Marie. And why, the old wretch?
Simply because our playful and innocent children call
after him as he passes.''

  A ``Building and Improvement Company,'' which
had not yet got its charter, ``but was going to,'' and
which had not, indeed, any tangible capital yet, but
``was going to have some,'' joined the ``Jean-ah Poquelin''
war. The haunted property would be such a
capital site for a market-house! They sent a deputation
to the old mansion to ask its occupant to sell. 
The deputation never got beyond the chained gate and
a very barren interview with the African mute. The
President of the Board was then empowered (for he
had studied French in Pennsylvania and was considered
qualified) to call and persuade M. Poquelin to
subscribe to the company's stock; but---

  ``Fact is, gentlemen,'' he said at the next meeting,
it would take us at least twelve months to make Mr.
Pokaleen understand the rather original features of
our system, and he wouldn't subscribe when we'd
done; besides, the only way to see him is to stop him
on the street."

  There was a great laugh from the Board; they
couldn't help it. ``Better meet a bear robbed of her
whelps,'' said one.

  ``You're mistaken as to that,''  said  the  President.
``I did meet him, and stopped him, and found him
quite polite. But I could get no satisfaction from
him; the fellow wouldn't talk in French, and when I
spoke in English he hoisted his old shoulders up, and
gave the same answer to every thing I said.''

  ``And that was---?'' asked one or two, impatient
of the pause.

  ``That it `don't worse wile?' ''

  One of the Board said: ``Mr. President, this market-house
project, as I take it, is not altogether a
selfish one; the community is to be benefited by it. 
We may feel that we are working in the public interest
[the Board smiled knowingly], if we employ all
possible means to oust this old nuisance from among
us. You may know that at the time the street was
cut through, this old Poquelann did all he could to
prevent it. It was owing to a certain connection
which I had with that affair that I heard a ghost story
[smiles, followed by a sudden dignified check]---ghost
story, which, of course, I am not going to relate; but
I may say that my profound conviction, arising from a
prolonged study of that story, is, that this old villain,
John Poquelann, has his brother locked up in that old
house. Now, if this is so, and we can fix it on him,
I merely _suggest_ that we can make the matter highly
useful. I don't know,'' he added, beginning to sit
down, ``but that it is an action we owe to the community
---hem!''

  ``How do you propose to handle the subject?''
asked the President.

  ``I was thinking,'' said the speaker, ``that, as a
Board of Directors, it would be unadvisable for us to
authorize any action involving trespass; but if you,
for instance, Mr. President, should, as it were, for
mere curiosity, _request_ some one, as, for instance, our
excellent Secretary, simply as a personal favor, to look
into the matter---this is merely a suggestion.''

  The Secretary smiled sufficiently to be understood
that, while he certainly did not consider such preposterous
service a part of his duties as secretary, he
might, notwithstanding, accede to the President's request;
and the Board adjourned.

  Little White, as the Secretary was called, was a
mild, kind-hearted little man, who, nevertheless, had
no fear of any thing, unless it was the fear of being
unkind.

  ``I tell you frankly,'' he privately said to the President,
``I go into this purely for reasons of my own.''

  The next day, a little after nightfall, one might
have descried this little man slipping along the rear
fence of the Poquelin place, preparatory to vaulting
over into the rank, grass-grown yard, and bearing
himself altogether more after the manner of a collector
of rare chickens than according to the usage of
secretaries.

  The picture presented to his eye was not calculated
to enliven his mind. The old mansion stood out
against the western sky, black and silent. One long,
lurid pencil-stroke along a sky of slate was all that
was left of daylight. No sign of life was apparent;
no light at any window, unless it might have been
on the side of the house hidden from view. No owls
were on the chimneys, no dogs were in the yard.

  He entered the place, and ventured up behind a small
cabin which stood apart from the house. Through one
of its many crannies he easily detected the African
mute crouched before a flickering pine-knot, his head
on his knees, fast asleep.

  He concluded to enter the mansion, and, with that
view, stood and scanned it. The broad rear steps of
the veranda would not serve him; he might meet some
one midway. He was measuring, with his eye, the
proportions of one of the pillars which supported it,
and estimating the practicability of climbing it, when
he heard a footstep. Some one dragged a chair out
toward the railing, then seemed to change his mind
and began to pace the veranda, his footfalls resounding
on the dry boards with singular loudness. Little
White drew a step backward, got the figure between
himself and the sky, and at once recognized the short,
broad-shouldered form of old Jean Poquelin.

   He sat down upon a billet of wood, and, to escape
the stings of a whining cloud of mosquitoes, shrouded
his face and neck in his handkerchief, leaving his eyes
uncovered.

     He had sat there but a moment when he noticed
a strange, sickening odor, faint, as if coming from
a distance, but loathsome and horrid.

  Whence could it come? Not from the cabin; not
from the marsh, for it was as dry as powder. It was
not in the air; it seemed to come from the ground.

  Rising up, he noticed, for the first time, a few steps
before him a narrow footpath leading toward the
house. He glanced down it---ha! right there was
some one coming---ghostly white!

  Quick as thought, and as noiselessly, he  lay  down  at
full length against the cabin. It was bold strategy,
and yet, there was no denying it, little White felt that
he was frightened. ``It is not a ghost,'' he said to
himself. ``I _know_ it cannot be a ghost;'' but the
perspiration burst out at every pore, and the air seemed
to thicken with beat. ``It is a living man,'' he said
in his thoughts. ``I hear his footstep, and I hear old
Poquelin's footsteps, too, separately, over on the veranda.
I am not discovered; the thing has passed;
there is that odor again; what a smell of death! Is it
coming back? Yes. It stops at the door of the
cabin. Is it peering in at the sleeping mute? It
moves away. It is in the path again. Now it is
gone.'' He shuddered. ``Now, if I dare venture,
the mystery is solved.'' He rose cautiously, close
against the cabin, and peered along the path.

  The figure of a man, a presence if not a body---but
whether clad in some white stuff or naked the darkness
would not allow him to determine---had turned, and
now, with a seeming painful gait, moved slowly from
him. ``Great Heaven! can it be that the dead do
walk?''  He withdrew again the hands which had
gone to   his eyes. The dreadful object passed between
two pillars and under the house. He listened. There
was a faint sound as of feet upon a staircase ; then all
was still except the measured tread of Jean Poquelin
walking on the veranda, and the heavy respirations of
the mute slumbering in the cabin.

  The little Secretary was about to retreat; but as he
looked once more toward the haunted house a dim
light appeared in the crack of a closed window, and
presently old Jean Poquelin came, dragoning his chair,
and sat down close against the shining cranny. He
spoke in a low, tender tone in the French tongue,
making some inquiry. An answer came from within. 
Was it the voice of a human? So unnatural was it
---so hollow, so discordant, so unearthly---that the
stealthy listener shuddered again from head to foot;
and when something stirred in some bushes near by---
though it may have been nothing more than a rat
---and came scuttling through the grass, the little
Secretary actually turned and fled. As he left the
enclosure he moved with bolder leisure through the
bushes; yet now and then he spoke aloud: ``Oh, oh!
I see, I understand!'' and shut his eyes in his hands.

  How strange that henceforth little White was the
champion of Jean Poquelin! In season and out of
season---wherever a word was uttered against him---
the Secretary, with a quiet, aggressive force that instantly
arrested gossip, demanded upon what authority
the statement or conjecture was made; but as he did
not condescend to explain his own remarkable attitude,
it was not long before the disrelish and suspicion
which had followed Jean Poquelin so many years fell
also upon him.

  It was only the next evening but one after his
adventure that he made himself a source of sullen
amazement to one hundred and fifty boys, by ordering
them to desist from their wanton hallooing. Old Jean
Poquelin, standing and shaking his cane, rolling out
his long-drawn maledictions, paused and stared, then
gave the Secretary a courteous bow and started on.

The boys, save one, from pure astonishment, ceased;
but a ruffianly little Irish lad, more daring than any
had yet been, threw a big hurtling clod, that struck
old Poquelin between the shoulders and burst like a
shell. The enraged old man wheeled with uplifted
staff to give chase to the scampering vagabond; and
---he may have tripped, or he may not, but he fell full
length. Little White hastened to help him up, but he
waved him off with a fierce imprecation and staggering
to his feet resumed his way homeward. His lips were
reddened with blood.

  Little White was on his way to the meeting of the
Board. He would have given all he dared spend to
have staid away, for he felt both too fierce and too
tremulous to brook the criticisms that were likely to be
made.

  ``I can't help it, gentlemen; I can't help you to
make a case against the old man, and I'm not going
to.''

  ``We did not expect this disappointment, Mr.
White.''

  ``I can't help that, sir. No, sir; you had better
not appoint any more investigations. Somebody'll investigate
himself into trouble. No, sir; it isn't a
threat, it is only my advice, but I warn you that whoever
takes the task in hand will rue it to his dying day
---which may be hastened, too.''

  The President expressed himself ``surprised.''

  ``I don't care a rush,'' answered little White,
wildly and foolishly. ``I don't care a rush if you are,
sir. No, my nerves are not disordered; my head's as
clear as a bell. No, I'm _not_ excited.''

  A Director remarked that the Secretary looked as
though he had waked from a nightmare.

  ``Well, sir, if you want to know the fact, I have;
and if you choose to cultivate old Poquelin's society
you can have one, too.''

  ``White,'' called a facetious member, but White did
not notice. ``White,'' he called again.

  ``What?'' demanded White, with a scowl.

  ``Did you see the ghost?''

  ``Yes, sir; I did,'' cried White, hitting the table,
and handing the President a paper which brought the
Board to other business.

  The story got among the gossips that somebody
(they were afraid to say little White) had been to the
Poquelin mansion by night and beheld something appalling.
The rumor was but a shadow of the truth,
magnified and distorted as is the manner of shadows. 
He had seen skeletons walking, and had barely escaped
the clutches of one by making the sign of the cross.

  Some madcap boys with an appetite for the horrible
plucked up courage to venture through the dried marsh
by the cattle-path, and come before the house at a
spectral hour when the air was full of bats. Something
which they but half saw---half a sight was
enough---sent them tearing back through the willow-brakes
and acacia bushes to their homes, where they
fairly dropped down, and cried:

  ``Was it white?'' ``No---yes---nearly so---we
can't tell---but we saw it.'' And one could hardly
doubt, to look at their ashen faces, that they had,
whatever it was.

  ``If that old rascal lived in the country we come
from,'' said certain Am<e'>ricains, ``he'd have been
tarred and feathered before now, wouldn't he, Sanders?''

  ``Well, now he just would.''

  ``And we'd have rid him on a rail, wouldn't we?''

  ``That's what I allow.''

  ``Tell you what you _could_ do.'' They were talking
to some rollicking Creoles who had assumed an absolute
necessity for doing _something._  ``What is it you
call this thing where an old man marries a young girl,
and you come out with horns and''---

  ``_Charivari?_'' asked the Creoles.

  ``Yes, that's it. Why don't you shivaree him?''
Felicitous suggestion.

  Little White, with his wife beside him, was sitting
on their doorsteps on the sidewalk, as Creole custom
had taught them, looking toward the sunset. They
had moved into the lately-opened street. The view
was not attractive on the score of beauty. The houses
were small and scattered, and across the flat commons,
spite of the lofty tangle of weeds and bushes, and
spite of the thickets of acacia, they needs must see the
dismal old Poquelin mansion, tilted awry and shutting
out the declining sun. The moon, white and slender,
was hanging the tip of its horn over one of the chimneys.

  ``And you say,'' said the Secretary, ``the old black
man has been going by here alone? Patty, suppose
old Poquelin should be concocting some mischief; he
don't lack provocation; the way that clod hit him the
other day was enough to have killed him. Why,
Patty, he dropped as quick as _that!_ No wonder you
haven't seen him. I wonder if they haven't heard
something about him up at the drug-store. Suppose
I go and see.''

  ``Do,'' said his wife.

  She sat alone for half an hour, watching that sudden
going out of the day peculiar to the latitude.

  ``That moon is ghost enough for one house,'' she
said, as her husband returned. ``It has gone right
down the chimney.''

  ``Patty,'' said little White, ``the drug-clerk says
the boys are going to shivaree old Poquelin to-night.
I'm going to try to stop it.''

  ``Why, White,'' said his wife, ``you'd  better   not.
You'll get hurt.''

  ``No, I'll not''

  ``Yes, you will.''

  ``I'm going to sit out here until they come along. 
They're compelled to pass right by here.''

  ``Why, White, it may be midnight before they start;
you're not going to sit out here till then.''

  ``Yes, I am.''

  ``Well, you're very foolish,'' said Mrs. White in an
undertone, looking anxious, and tapping one of the
steps with her foot.

  They sat a very long time talking over little family
matters.

  ``What's that?'' at last said Mrs. White.

  ``That's the nine-o'clock gun,'' said White, and
they relapsed into a long-sustained, drowsy silence.

  ``Patty, you'd better go in and go to bed,'' said he
at last.

  ``I'm not sleepy.''

  ``Well, you're very foolish,'' quietly remarked little
White, and again silence fell upon them.

  ``Patty, suppose I walk out to the old house and
see if I can find out any thing.''

  ``Suppose,'' said she, ``you don't do any such---
listen!''

  Down the street arose a great hubbub. Dogs and
boys were howling and barking; men were laughing,
shouting, groaning, and blowing horns, whooping, and
clanking cow-bells, whinnying, and howling, and rattling
pots and pans.

  ``They  are  coming  this  way,''  said  little  White.
You had better go into the house, Patty.''

  ``So had you.''

  ``No. I'm going to see if I can't stop them.''

  ``Why, White!''

  ``I'll be back in a minute,'' said White, and went
toward the noise.

  In a few moments the little Secretary met the mob. 
The pen hesitates on the word, for there is a respectable
difference, measurable only on the scale of the half
century, between a mob and a _charivari._  Little White
lifted his ineffectual voice. He faced the head of the
disorderly column, and cast himself about as if he
were made of wood and moved by the jerk of a string. 
He rushed to one who seemed, from the size and clatter
of his tin pan, to be a leader. ``_Stop these fellows,
Bienvenu, stop them just a minute, till I tell them
something._'' Bienvenu turned and brandished his instruments
of discord in an imploring way to the crowd. 
They slackened their pace, two or three bushed their
horns and joined the prayer of little White and Bienvenu
for silence. The throng halted. The hush was
delicious.

  ``Bienvenu,'' said little White, ``don't shivaree old
Poquelin to-night ; he's''---

  ``My fwang,'' said the swaying Bienvenu, ``who
tail you I goin' to chahivahi somebody, eh? You sink
bickause I make a little playfool wiz zis tin pan zat I
am _dhonk_---?''

  ``Oh, no, Bienvenu, old fellow, you're all right. I
was afraid you might not know that old Poquelin was
sick, you know, but you're not going there, are you?''

  ``My fwang, I vay soy to tail you zat you ah dhonk
as de dev'. I am _shem_ of you. I ham ze servan' of
ze _publique._  Zese _citoyens_ goin' to wickwest Jean
Poquelin to give to the Ursuline' two hondred fifty
dolla' ''---

  ``_H<e'> quoi!_'' cried a listener, ``_Cinq cent piastres,
oui!''

  ``Oui!'' said Bienvenu, ``and if he wiffuse we make
him some lit' _musique;_ ta-ra-ta!'' He hoisted a
merry hand and foot, then frowning, added: ``Old
Poquelin got no bizniz dhink s'much w'isky.''

  ``But, gentlemen,'' said little White, around whom
a circle had gathered, ``the old man is very sick.''

  ``My faith!'' cried a tiny Creole, ``we did not make
him to be sick. W'en we have say we going make _le
charivari,_ do you want that we hall tell a lie? My
faith! 'sfools!''

  ``But you can shivaree somebody else,'' said desperate
little White.

  ``_Oui!_'' cried Bienvenu, ``_et chahivahi_ Jean-ah
Poquelin tomo'w!''

  ``Let us go to Madame Schneider!'' cried two or
three, and amid huzzas and confused cries, among
which was heard a stentorian Celtic call for drinks, the
crowd again began to move.

   ``_Cent piastres pour l'h<o^>pital de charit<e'>!_''

  ``Hurrah!''

  ``One hongred dolla' for Charity Hospital!''

  ``Hurrah!''

  ``Whang!'' went a tin pan, the crowd yelled, and
Pandemonium gaped again. They were off at a right
angle.

  Nodding, Mrs. White looked at the mantle-clock. 

  ``Well, if it isn't away after midnight.''

  The hideous noise down street was passing beyond
earshot. She raised a sash and listened. For a moment
there was silence. Some one came to the door. 

  ``Is that you, White?''

  ``Yes.'' He entered. ``I succeeded, Patty.''

  ``Did you?'' said Patty, joyfully.

  ``Yes. They've gone down to shivaree the old
Dutchwoman who married her step-daughter's sweet-heart.
They say she has got to pay a hundred dollars
to the hospital before they stop.''

  The couple retired, and Mrs. White slumbered. 
She was awakened by her husband snapping the lid of
his watch.

  ``What time?'' she asked.

  ``Half-past three. Patty, I haven't slept a wink.
Those fellows are out yet. Don't you hear them?''

  ``Why, White, they're coming this way!''

  ``I know they are,'' said White, sliding out of bed
and drawing on his clothes, ``and they're coming fast. 
You'd better go away from that window, Patty. My!
what a clatter!''

  ``Here they are,'' said Mrs. White, but her husband
was gone. Two or three hundred men and boys
pass the place at a rapid walk straight down the broad,
new street, toward the hated house of ghosts. The
din was terrific. She saw little White at the head of
the rabble brandishing his arms and trying in vain to
make himself heard; but they only shook their heads,
laughing and hooting the louder, and so passed, bearing
him on before them.

  Swiftly they pass out from among the houses, away
from the dim oil lamps of the street, out into the
broad starlit commons, and enter the willowy jungles
of the haunted ground. Some hearts fail and their
owners lag behind and turn back, suddenly remembering
how near morning it is. But the most part push
on, tearing the air with their clamor.

  Down ahead of them in the long, thicket-darkened
way there is---singularly enough---a faint, dancing
light. It must be very near the old house; it is. It
has stopped now. It is a lantern, and is under a well-known
sapling which has grown up on the wayside
since the canal was filled. Now it swings mysteriously
to and fro. A goodly number of the more ghost-fearing
give up the sport; but a full hundred move
forward at a run, doubling their devilish howling and
banging.

  Yes; it is a lantern, and there are two persons
under the tree. The crowd draws near---drops into
a walk; one of the two is the old African mute; he
lifts the lantern up so that it shines on the other; the
crowd recoils; there is a hush of all clangor, and all
at once, with a cry of mingled fright and horror from
every throat, the whole throng rushes back, dropping
every thing, sweeping past little White and hurrying
on, never stopping until the jungle is left behind, and
then to find that not one in ten has seen the cause of
the stampede, and not one of the tenth is certain what
it was.

  There is one huge fellow among them who looks
capable of any villany. He finds something to mount
on, and, in the Creole _patois_, calls a general halt. 
Bienvenu sinks down, and, vainly trying to recline
gracefully, resigns the leadership. The herd gather
round the speaker; he assures them that they have
been outraged. Their right peaceably to traverse the
public streets has been trampled upon. Shall such
encroachments be endured? It is now daybreak. Let
them go now by the open light of day and force a free
passage of the public highway!

  A scattering consent was the response, and the
crowd, thinned now and drowsy, straggled quietly
down toward the old house. Some drifted ahead,
others sauntered behind, but every  one, as he again
neared the tree, came to a stand-still. Little White
sat upon a bank of turf on the opposite side of the
way looking very stern and sad. To each new-comer
he put the same question:

  ``Did you come here to go to old Poquelin's?''

  ``Yes.''

  ``He's dead.'' And if the shocked hearer started
away he would say: ``Don't go away.''

  ``Why not?''

  ``I want you to go to the funeral presently.''

  If some Louisianian, too loyal to dear France or
Spain to understand English, looked bewildered, some
one would interpret for him; and presently they went. 
Little White led the van, the crowd trooping after him
down the middle of the way. The gate, that had
never been seen before unchained, was open. Stern
little White stopped a short distance from it; the
rabble stopped behind him. Something was moving
out from under the veranda. The many whisperers
stretched upward to see. The African mute came very
slowly toward the gate, leading by a cord in the nose
a small brown bull, which was harnessed to a rude
cart. On the flat body of the cart, under a black
cloth, were seen the outlines of a long box.

  ``Hats off, gentlemen,'' said little White, as the box
came in view, and the crowd silently uncovered.

  ``Gentlemen,'' said little White, ``here come the
last remains of Jean Marie Poquelin, a better man,
I'm afraid, with all his sins,---yes a better---a kinder
man to his blood---a man of more self-forgetful good-ness---
than all of you put together will ever dare to
be.''

  There was a profound hush as the vehicle came
creaking through the gate; but when it turned away
from them toward the forest, those in front started
suddenly. There was a backward rush, then all stood
still again staring one way; for there, behind the bier,
with eyes cast down and labored step, walked the
living remains---all that was left of little Jacques
Poquelin, the long-hidden brother---a leper, as white
as snow.

  Dumb with horror, the cringing crowd gazed upon
the walking death. They watched, in silent awe, the
slow _cort<e'>ge_ creep down the long, straight road and
lessen on the view, until by and by it stopped where a
wild, unfrequented path branched off into the undergrowth
toward the rear of the ancient city.

  ``They are going to the _Terre aux L<e'>preux,_'' said
one in the crowd. The rest watched them in silence.

  The little bull was set free; the mute, with the
strength of an ape, lifted the long box to his shoulder. 
For a moment more the mute and the leper stood in
sight, while the former adjusted his heavy burden;
then, without one backward glance upon the unkind
human world, turning their faces toward the ridge in
the depths of the swamp known as the Leper's Land,
they stepped into the jungle, disappeared, and were
never seen again.
