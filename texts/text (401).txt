Undoubtedly Shakespeare's son-in-law, Dr. Hall, attended him, but the nature of his finalillness is unknown.  A legend has grown up, based on an entry in John Ward, a Stratfordvicar's, diary.  Ward wrote that "Shakspear Drayton and Ben Jhonson had a merry meetingand it seems drank too hard for Shakespear died of a feavour there contracted."  Theproblem is that the report came from a diary half a century after Shakespeare's death, andcannot be confirmed otherwise.  Undoubtedly Ward was privy to local gossip and knewJudith Shakespeare in her later years, but we cannot know if this story amounts to anythingmore than gossip.Shakespeare's Will.  Whatever the cause of Shakespeare's death, we find him calling forhis attorney to revise his will on March 25 (new years day, old style) of 1616.  Themarriage of his daughter Judith to the unsavory Thomas Quiney made need ofamendments.  The will is, as G. E. Bentley says, "a characteristic will of a man of propertyin the reign of James I." (Shakespeare: A Biographical Handbook, 1961).  Its provisionsare numerous and complicated, but in sum:      1.He left £100 to his daughter Judith for a marriage portion and another £50 if she       renounce any claim in the Chapel Lane cottage near New Place previously       purchased by Shakespeare.  He left another £150 to Judith if she lived another       three years, but forbade her husband any claim to it unless he settled on her lands       worth the £150.   If Judith failed to live another three years, the £150 was to have       gone to Shakespeare's granddaughter Elizabeth Hall.      2.He left £30 to his sister Joan Hart, and permited her to stay on for a nominal rent       in the Western of the two houses on Henley Street, which Shakespeare himself       inherited from his father in 1601.  He left each of Joan's three sons £5.      3.He left all his plate, except a silver bowl left to Judith, to his granddaughter       Elizabeth.      4.He left £10 to the poor of Stratford, a large amount considering similar bequeaths       of the time.      5.He left his sword and various small bequests to local friends, including money to       buy memorial rings.  His lifelong friend Hamnet Sadler is mentioned in this       connection.      6.He singles out "my ffellowes John Hemynges Richard Burbage & Henry       Cundell," leaving them 26s8d to "buy them Ringes."  Heminges and Condell were,       seven years later, to become the editors of the First Folio.      7.He does not mention his wife Anne (though it is commonly pointed out that it       would have been her right through English common law to one-third of his estate       as well as residence for life at New Place), except to leave her his "second best       bed."      8."All the Rest of my goodes Chattels Leases plate Jewels & household stuffe       whatsoever after my dettes and Legasies paied & my funerall expences dischared"       he left to his son-in-law John Hall and his daughter Susanna. It is often wondered that no books or play scripts are mentioned in the will, but of courseShakespeare would have owned no play scripts, since they were the property of the King'sMen.  Any books would not have been itemized in the will but would have been part of his"goodes."  Shakespeare died on April 23, 1616 and was buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity ChurchApril 25.  On the slab over his grave appear the words:              GOOD FREND FOR JESUS SAKE FORBEARE,              TO DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE.              BLESTE BE Ye MAN Yt SPARES THES STONES,              AND CURST BE HE Yt MOVES MY BONES.His wishes have been honored, at least by men, though the grave is near the Avon and workof the river underground may have had no respect for the curse.  A painted funerary bustwas also erected in the church early in the seventeenth century that has lasted to today.The First Folio.  Seven years after his death, Shakespeare's fellows Heminges andCondell brought forth the First Folio: Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &Tragedies.  It published 36 plays, 18 of which were published therein for the first time. The volume was probably inspired by the 1616 folio edition of  Ben Jonson's Workes.  Ittakes time to compile and edit such a large volume, and Heminges and Condell wereotherwise busy men.  In the prefatory material to the First Folio was printed the Martin Droeshout engraving ofShakespeare, one of only two likenesses we have of the dramatist that can make claim toany sort of authenticity.
