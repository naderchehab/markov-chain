               CAF<E'> DES <E'>XILES.




  That which in 1835---I think he said thirty-five
---was a reality in the Rue Burgundy---I think he
said Burgundy---is now but a reminiscence. Yet so
vividly was its story told me, that at this moment the
old Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s appears before my eye, floating in
the clouds of revery, and I doubt not I see it just as
it was in the old times.

  An antiquated story-and-a-half Creole cottage sitting
right down on the banquette, as do the Choctaw
squaws who sell bay and sassafras and life-everlasting,
with a high, close board-fence shutting out of view
the diminutive garden on the southern side. An ancient
willow droops over the roof of round tiles, and
partly hides the discolored stucco, which keeps dropping
off into the garden as though the old caf<e'> was
stripping for the plunge into oblivion---disrobing for
its execution. I see, well up in the angle of the broad
side gable, shaded by its rude awning of clapboards,
as the eyes of an old dame are shaded by her wrinkled
hand, the window of Pauline. Oh for the image of
the maiden, were it but for one moment, leaning out
of the casement to hang her mocking-bird and looking
down into the garden,---where, above the barrier of
old boards, I see the top of the fig-tree, the pale green
clump of bananas, the tall palmetto with its jagged
crown, Pauline's own two orange-trees holding up
their hands toward the window, heavy with the promises
of autumn; the broad, crimson mass of the many-stemmed
oleander, and the crisp boughs of the pomegranate
loaded with freckled apples, and with here
and there a lingering scarlet blossom.

  The Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s, to use a figure, flowered, bore
fruit, and dropped it long ago---or rather Time and
Fate, like some uncursed Adam and Eve, came side
by side and cut away its clusters, as we sever the
golden burden of the banana from its stem; then,
like a banana which has borne its fruit, it was razed
to the ground and made way for a newer, brighter
growth. I believe it would set every tooth on edge
should I go by there now,---now that I have heard
the story,---and see the old site covered by the ``Shoo-fly
Coffee-house.'' Pleasanter far to close my eyes
and call to view the unpretentious portals of the old
caf<e'>, with her children---for such those exiles seem
to me---dragging their rocking-chairs out, and sitting
in their wonted group under the long, out-reaching
eaves which shaded the banquette of the Rue Burgundy.

  It was in 1835 that the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s was, as one
might say, in full blossom. Old M. D'Hemecourt,
father of Pauline and host of the caf<e'>, himself a refugee
from San Domingo, was the cause---at least the
human cause---of its opening. As its white-curtained,
glazed doors expanded, emitting a little puff of his
own cigarette smoke, it was like the bursting of catalpa
blossoms, and the exiles came like bees, pushing into
the tiny room to sip its rich variety of tropical sirups,
its lemonades, its orangeades, its orgeats, its barley-waters,
and its outlandish wines, while they talked of
dear home---that is to say, of Barbadoes, of Martinique,
of San Domingo, and of Cuba.

  There were Pedro and Benigno, and Fernandez and
Francisco, and Benito. Benito was a tall, swarthy
man, with immense gray moustachios, and hair as
harsh as tropical grass and gray as ashes. When he
could spare his cigarette from his lips, he would tell
you in a cavernous voice, and with a wrinkled smile,
that he was ``a-t-thorty-seveng.''

  There was Martinez of San Domingo, yellow as a
canary, always sitting with one leg curled under him,
and holding the back of his head in his knitted fingers
against the back of his rocking-chair. Father, mother,
brother, sisters, all, had been massacred in the struggle
of '21 and '22; he alone was left to tell the tale,
and told it often, with that strange, infantile insensibility
to the solemnity of his bereavement so peculiar
to Latin people.

  But, besides these, and many who need no mention,
there were two in particular, around whom all the
story of the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s, of old M. D'Hemecourt
and of Pauline, turns as on a double centre. First,
Manuel Mazaro, whose small, restless eyes were as
black and bright as those of a mouse, whose light talk
became his dark girlish face, and whose redundant
locks curled so prettily and so wonderfully black under
the fine white brim of his jaunty Panama. He had
the hands of a woman, save that the nails were stained
with the smoke of cigarettes. He could play the
guitar delightfully, and wore his knife down behind
his coat-collar.

  The second was ``Major'' Galahad Shaughnessy. 
I imagine I can see him, in his white duck, brass-buttoned
roundabout, with his sabreless belt peeping
out beneath, all his boyishness in his sea-blue eyes,
leaning lightly against the door-post of the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s as a child leans against his mother, running his
fingers over a basketful of fragrant limes, and watching
his chance to strike some solemn Creole under the
fifth rib with a good old Irish joke.

  Old D'Hemecourt drew him close to his bosom. 
The Spanish Creoles were, as the old man termed
it, both cold and hot, but never warm. Major Shaughnessy
was warm, and it was no uncommon thing to
find those two apart from the others, talking in an
undertone, and playing at _confidantes_ like two school-girls.
The kind old man was at this time drifting
close up to his sixtieth year. There was much he
could tell of San Domingo, whither he had been carried
from Martinique in his childhood, whence he had
become a refugee to Cuba, and thence to New Orleans
in the flight of 1809.

  It fell one day to Manuel Mazaro's lot to discover,
by sauntering within earshot, that to Galahad Shaughnessy
only, of all the children of the Caf<e'>, des Exil<e'>s,
the good host spoke long and confidentially concerning
his daughter. The words, half heard and magnified
like objects seem in a fog, meaning Manuel
Mazaro knew not what, but made portentous by his
suspicious nature, were but the old man's recital of
the grinding he had got between the millstones of his
poverty and his pride, in trying so long to sustain, for
little Pauline's sake, that attitude before society which
earns respect from a surface-viewing world. It was
while he was telling this that Manuel Mazaro drew
near; the old man paused in an embarrassed way;
the Major, sitting sidewise in his chair, lifted his cheek
from its resting-place on his elbow; and Mazaro,
after standing an awkward moment, turned away with
such an inward feeling as one may guess would arise
in a heart full of Cuban blood, not unmixed with
Indian.

  As he moved off, M. D'Hemecourt resumed: that in
a last extremity he had opened, partly from dire want,
partly for very love to homeless souls, the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s. He had hoped that, as strong drink and high
words were to be alike unknown to it, it might not
prejudice sensible people; but it had. He had no
doubt they said among themselves, ``She is an excellent
and beautiful girl and deserving all respect;''
and respect they accorded, but their _respects_ they
never came to pay.

  ``A caf<e'> is a caf<e'>,'' said the old gentleman. ``It is
nod possib' to ezcape him, aldough do Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s
is differen' from de rez.''

  ``It's different from the Caf<e'> des R<e'>fugi<e'>s,'' suggested
the Irishman.

  ``Differen' as possib','' replied M. D'Hemecourt. 
He looked about upon the walls. The shelves were
luscious with ranks of cooling sirups which he alone
knew how to make. The expression of his face
changed from sadness to a gentle pride, which spoke
without words, saying---and let our story pause a
moment to hear it say:

  ``If any poor exile, from any island where guavas
or mangoes or plantains grow, wants a draught which
will make him see his home among the cocoa-palms,
behold the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s ready to take the poor child
up and give him the breast! And if gold or silver he
has them not, why Heaven and Santa Maria, and
Saint Christopher bless him! It makes no difference. 
Here is a rocking-chair, here a cigarette, and here a
light from the host's own tinder. He will pay when he
can.''

  As this easily pardoned pride said, so it often occurred;
and if the newly come exile said his father
was a Spaniard---``Come!'' old M. D'Hemecourt
would cry; ``another glass; it is an innocent drink;
my mother was a Castilian.'' But, if the exile said
his mother was a Frenchwoman, the glasses would be
forthcoming all the same, for ``My father,'' the old
man would say, ``was a Frenchman of Martinique,
with blood as pure as that wine and at heart as sweet
as this honey; come, a glass of orgeat;'' and he
would bring it himself in a quart tumbler.

  Now, there are jealousies and jealousies. There
are people who rise up quickly and kill, and there are
others who turn their hot thoughts over silently in
their minds as a brooding bird turns her eggs in the
nest. Thus did Manuel Mazaro, and took it ill that
Galahad should see a vision in the temple while he
and all the brethren tarried without. Pauline had been
to the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s in some degree what the image
of the Virgin was to their churches at home; and for
her father to whisper her name to one and not to another
was, it seemed to Mazaro, as if the old man,
were he a sacristan, should say to some single worshiper,
``Here, you may have this madonna; I make
it a present to you.'' Or, if such was not the handsome
young Cuban's feeling, such, at least, was the
disguise his jealousy put on. If Pauline was to be
handed down from her niche, why, then, farewell Caf<e'>
des Exil<e'>s. She was its preserving influence, she
made the place holy; she was the burning candles on
the altar. Surely the reader will pardon the pen that
lingers in the mention of her.

  And yet I know not how to describe the forbearing,
unspoken tenderness with which all these exiles regarded
the maiden. In the balmy afternoons, as I
have said, they gathered about their mother's knee,
that is to say, upon the banquette outside the door. 
There, lolling back in their rocking-chairs, they would
pass the evening hours with oft-repeated tales of home
and the moon would come out and glide among the
clouds like a silver barge among islands wrapped in
mist, and they loved the silently gliding orb with a
sort of worship, because from her soaring height she
looked down at the same moment upon them and upon
their homes in the far Antilles. It was somewhat thus
that they looked upon Pauline as she seemed to them
held up half way to heaven, they knew not how. Ah!
those who have been pilgrims; who have wandered
out beyond harbor and light; whom fate hath led in
lonely paths strewn with thorns and briers not of their
own sowing; who, homeless in a land of homes, see
windows gleaming and doors ajar, but not for them,---
it is they who well understand what the worship is that
cries to any daughter of our dear mother Eve whose
footsteps chance may draw across the path, the silent,
beseeching cry, ``Stay a little instant that I may look
upon you. Oh, woman, beautifier of the earth! Stay
till I recall the face of my sister; stay yet a moment
while I look from afar, with helpless-hanging hands,
upon the softness of thy cheek, upon the folded coils
of thy shining hair; and my spirit shall fall down and
say those prayers which I may never again---God
knoweth---say at home.''

  She was seldom seen; but sometimes, when the
lounging exiles would be sitting in their afternoon
circle under the eaves, and some old man would tell
his tale of fire and blood and capture and escape, and
the heads would lean forward from the chair-backs
and a great stillness would follow the ending of the
story, old M. D'Hemecourt would all at once speak up
and say, laying his hands upon the narrator's knee,
``Comrade, your throat is dry, here are fresh limes;
let my dear child herself come and mix you a lemonade.''
Then the neighbors over the way, sitting about
their doors, would by and by softly say, ``See, see!
there is Pauline!'' and all the exiles would rise from
their rocking-chairs, take off their hats and stand as
men stand in church, while Pauline came out like the
moon from a cloud, descended the three steps of the
caf<e'> door, and stood with waiter and glass, a new Rebecca
with her pitcher, before the swarthy wanderer.

  What tales that would have been tear-compelling,
nay, heart-rending, had they not been palpable inventions,
the pretty, womanish Mazaro from time to time
poured forth, in the ever ungratified hope that the goddess
might come down with a draught of nectar for
him, it profiteth not to recount; but I should fail to
show a family feature of the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s did I
omit to say that these make-believe adventures were
heard with every mark of respect and credence; while,
on the other hand, they were never attempted in the
presence of the Irishman. He would have moved an
eyebrow, or made some barely audible sound, or
dropped some seemingly innocent word, and the whole
company, spite of themselves, would have smiled. 
Wherefore, it may be doubted whether at any time the
curly-haired young, Cuban had that playful affection
for his Celtic comrade, which a habit of giving little
velvet taps to Galahad's cheek made a show of.

  Such was the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s, such its inmates, such
its guests, when certain apparently trivial events began
to fall around it as germs of blight fall upon corn, and
to bring about that end which cometh to all things.

  The little seed of jealousy, dropped into the heart
of Manuel Mazaro, we have already taken into account.

  Galahad Shaughnessy began to be specially active
in organizing a society of Spanish Americans, the design
of which, as set forth in its manuscript constitution,
was to provide proper funeral honors to such of
their membership as might be overtaken by death;
and, whenever it was practicable, to send their ashes
to their native land. Next to Galahad in this movement
was an elegant old Mexican physician, Dr. ------,
---his name escapes me---whom the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s
sometimes took upon her lap---that is to say door-step
---but whose favorite resort was the old Caf<e'> des
R<e'>fugi<e'>s in the Rue Royale (Royal Street, as it was
beginning to be called). Manuel Mazaro was made
secretary.

  It was for some reason thought judicious for the
society to hold its meetings in various places, now
here, now there; but the most frequent rendezvous
was the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s; it was quiet; those Spanish
Creoles, however they may afterward cackle, like to
lay their plans noiselessly, like a hen in a barn. 
There was a very general confidence in this old institution,
a kind of inward assurance that ``mother
wouldn't tell;'' though, after all, what great secrets
could there be connected with a mere burial society?

  Before the hour of meeting, the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s
always sent away her children and closed her door. 
Presently they would commence returning, one by one,
as a flock of wild fowl will do, that has been startled
up from its accustomed haunt. Frequenters of the
Caf<e'> des R<e'>fugi<e'>s also would appear. A small gate
in the close garden-fence let them into a room behind
the caf<e'> proper, and by and by the apartment would
be full of dark-visaged men conversing in the low,
courteous tone common to their race. The shutters
of doors and windows were closed and the chinks
stopped with cotton; some people are so jealous of
observation.

  On a certain night after one of these meetings had
dispersed in its peculiar way, the members retiring two
by two at intervals, Manuel Mazaro and M. D'Hemecourt
were left alone, sitting close together in the
dimly lighted room, the former speaking, the other,
with no pleasant countenance, attending. It seemed
to the young Cuban a proper precaution---he was
made of precautions---to speak in English. His voice
was barely audible.

  ``------ sayce to me, `Manuel, she t-theeng I want-n
to marry hore.' Se<n~>or, you shouth 'ave see' him
laugh!''

  M. D'Hemecourt lifted up his head, and laid his
hand upon the young man's arm.

  ``Manuel Mazaro,'' he began, ``iv dad w'ad you
say is nod'' ---

  The Cuban interrupted.

  ``If is no' t-thrue you will keel Manuel Mazaro?---
a' r-r-right-a!'

  ``No,'' said the tender old man, ``no, bud h-I am
positeef dad de Madjor will shood you.''

  Mazaro nodded, and lifted one finger for attention.

  ``------  sayce to me, `Manuel, you  goin'  tell-a  Se<n~>or
D'Hemecourt, I fin'-a you some nigh' an' cut-a you'
heart ou'. An' I sayce to heem-a, `Boat-a if Se<n~>or
D'Hemecourt he fin'-in' ou' frone Pauline' ''---

  ``_Silence!_ fiercely cried the old man. ``My God!
'Sieur Mazaro, neider you, neider somebody helse s'all
h'use de nem of me daughter. It is nod possib' dad
you s'all spick him! I cannot pearmid thad.''

  While the old man was speaking these vehement
words, the Cuban was emphatically nodding approval.

  ``Co-rect-a, co-rect-a, Se<n~>or,'' he replied. ``Se<n~>or,
you' r-r-ri-ght-a; escuse-a me, Se<n~>or, escuse-a me. 
Se<n~>or D'Hemecourt, Mayor Shaughness', when he
talkin' wi' me he usin' hore-a name o the t-thime-a!''

  ``My fren','' said M. D'Hemecourt, rising and
speaking with labored control, ``I muz tell you good
nighd. You 'ave sooprise me a verry gred deal. I
s'all _in_vestigade doze ting; an', Manuel Mazaro, h-I
am a hole man; bud I will requez you, iv dad wad
you say is nod de true, my God! not to h-ever ritturn
again ad de Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s.''

  Mazaro smiled and nodded. His host opened the
door into the garden, and, as the young man stepped
out, noticed even then how handsome was his face and
figure, and how the odor of the night jasmine was
filling the air with an almost insupportable sweetness. 
The Cuban paused a moment, as if to speak, but
checked himself, lifted his girlish face, and looked up
to where the daggers of the palmetto-tree were crossed
upon the face of the moon, dropped his glance, touched
his Panama, and silently followed by the bare-headed
old man, drew open the little garden-gate, looked cautiously
out, said good-night, and stepped into the
street.

  As M. D'Hemecourt returned to the door through
which he had come, he uttered an ejaculation of astonishment.
Pauline stood before him. She spoke hurriedly
in French.

  ``Papa, papa, it is not true.''

  ``No, my child,'' he responded, ``I am sure it is
not true; I am sure it is all false; but why do I find
you out of bed so late, little bird? The night is nearly
gone.''

  He laid his hand upon her cheek.

  ``Ah, papa, I cannot deceive you. I thought Manuel
would tell you something of this kind, and I
listened.''

  The father's face immediately betrayed a new and
deeper distress.

  ``Pauline, my child,'' he said with tremulous voice,
``if Manuel's story is all false, in the name of Heaven
how could you think he was going to tell it?''

  He unconsciously clasped his hands. The good
child had one trait which she could not have inherited
from her father; she was quick-witted and discerning;
yet now she stood confounded.

  ``Speak, my child,'' cried the alarmed old man;
``speak! let me live, and not die.''

  ``Oh, papa,'' she cried, ``I do not know!''

  The old man groaned.

  ``Papa, papa,'' she cried again, ``I felt it; I know
not how; something told me.''

  ``Alas!'' exclaimed the old man, ``if it was  your
conscience!''

  ``No, no, no, papa,'' cried Pauline, ``but I was
afraid of Manuel Mazaro, and I think he hates him
---and I think he will hurt him in any way he can
---and I _know_ he will even try to kill him. Oh! my
God!''

  She struck her hands together above her head, and
burst into a flood of tears. Her father looked upon
her with such sad sternness as his tender nature was
capable of. He laid hold of one of her arms to draw
a hand from the face whither both hands had gone.

  ``You know something else,'' he said; ``you know
that the Major loves you, or you think so: is it not
true ?''

  She dropped both hands, and, lifting her streaming
eyes that had nothing to hide straight to his, suddenly
said:

  ``I would give worlds to think so!'' and sunk upon
the floor.

  He was melted and convinced in one instant.

  ``Oh, my child, my child,'' he cried, trying to lift
her. ``Oh, my poor little Pauline, your papa is not
angry. Rise, my little one; so; kiss me; heaven
bless thee! Pauline, treasure, what shall I do with
thee? Where shall I hide thee?''

  ``You have my counsel already, papa.''

  ``Yes, my child, and you were right. The Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s never should have been opened. It is no place
for you; no place at all.''

  ``Let us leave it,'' said Pauline.

  ``Ah! Pauline, I would close it to-morrow if I
could, but now it is too late; I cannot.''

  ``Why?'' asked Pauline pleadingly.

  She had cast an arm about his neck. Her tears
sparkled with a smile.

  ``My daughter, I cannot tell you; you must go now
to bed; good-night---or good-morning; God keep
you!''

  ``Well, then, papa,'' she said, ``have no fear; you
need not hide me; I have my prayer-book, and my
altar, and my garden, and my window; my garden is
my fenced city, and my window my watch-tower; do
you see?''

  ``Ah! Pauline,'' responded the father, ``but I have
been letting the enemy in and out at pleasure.''

  ``Good-night,'' she answered, and kissed him three
times on either cheek; ``the blessed Virgin will take
care of us; good-night; _he_ never said those things;
not he; good-night.''

  The next evening, Galahad Shaughnessy and Manuel
Mazaro met at that ``very different'' place, the Caf<e'>
des R<e'>fugi<e'>s. There was much free talk going on
about Texan annexation, about chances of war with
Mexico, about San Domingan affairs, about Cuba and
many et-ceteras. Galahad was in his usual gay mood. 
He strode about among a mixed company of Louisianais,
Cubans, and Am<'e>ricains, keeping them in a
great laugh with his account of one of Ole Bull's
concerts, and how he had there extorted an invitation
from M. and Mme. Devoti to attend one of their
famous children's fancy dress balls.

  ``Halloo!'' said he as Mazaro approached, ``heer's
the etheerial Angelica herself. Look-ut heer, sissy,
why ar'n't ye in the maternal arms of the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s ?''

  Mazaro smiled amiably and sat down. A moment
after, the Irishman, stepping away from his companions,
stood before the young Cuban, and asked,
with a quiet business air:

  ``D'ye want to see me, Mazaro?''

  The Cuban nodded, and they went aside. Mazaro,
in a few quick words, looking at his pretty foot the
while, told the other on no account to go near the Caf<e'>
des Exil<e'>s, as there were two men hanging about there,
evidently watching for him, and---

  ``Wut's the use o' that?'' asked Galahad; ``I say,
wut's the use o' that?''

  Major Shaughnessy's habit of repeating part of his
words arose from another, of interrupting any person
who might be speaking.

  ``They must know---I say they must know that
whenever I'm nowhurs else I'm heer. What do they
want?''

  Mazaro made a gesture, signifying caution and
secrecy, and smiled, as if to say, ``You ought to
know.''

  ``Aha!'' said the Irishman softly. ``Why don't
they come here?''

  ``Z-afrai','' said Mazaro; ``d'they frai' to do
an'teen een d-these-a crowth.''

  ``That's so,'' said the Irishman; ``I say, that's so.
if I don't feel very much like go-un, I'll not go; I
say, I'll not go. We've no business to-night, eh,
Mazaro ?''

  ``No, Se<n~>or.''

  A second evening was much the same, Mazaro repeating
his warning. But when, on the third evening,
the Irishman again repeated his willingness to stay
away from the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s unless he should feel
strongly impelled to go, it was with the mental reservation
that he did feel very much in that humor, and,
unknown to Mazaro, should thither repair, if only to
see whether some of those deep old fellows were not
contriving a practical joke.

  ``Mazaro,'' said he, ``I'm go-un around the caurnur
a bit; I want ye to wait heer till I come back. I say
I want ye to wait heer till I come back; I'll be gone
about three-quarters of an hour.''

  Mazaro assented. He saw with satisfaction the
Irishman start in a direction opposite that in which
lay the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s, tarried fifteen or twenty minutes,
and then, thinking he could step around to the
Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s and return before the expiration of
the allotted time, hurried out.

  Meanwhile that peaceful habitation sat in the moonlight
with her children about her feet. The company
outside the door was somewhat thinner than common. 
M. D'Hemecourt was not among them, but was sitting
in the room behind the caf<e'>. The long table which the
burial society used at their meetings extended across
the apartment, and a lamp had been placed upon it. 
M. D'Hemecourt sat by the lamp. Opposite him was
a chair, which seemed awaiting an expected occupant. 
Beside the old man sat Pauline. They were talking in
cautious undertones, and in French.

  ``No,'' she seemed to insist; ``we do not know that
he refuses to come. We only know  that Manuel says
so.''

  The father shook his head sadly. ``When has he
ever staid away three nights together before?'' he
asked. ``No, my child; it is intentional. Manuel
urges him to come, but he only sends poor excuses.''

  ``But,'' said the girl, shading her face from the
lamp and speaking with some suddenness, ``why have
you not sent word to him by some other person?''

  M. D'Hemecourt looked up at his daughter a moment,
and then smiled at his own simplicity.

  ``Ah!'' he said. ``Certainly; and that is what
I will---run away, Pauline. There is Manuel, now,
ahead of time!''

  A step was heard inside the caf<e'>. The maiden,
though she, knew the step was not Mazaro's, rose hastily,
opened the nearest door, and disappeared. She
had barely closed it behind her when Galahad Shaughnessy
entered the apartment.

  M'Hemecourt rose up, both surprised and confused.

  ``Good-evening, Munsher D'Himecourt,'' said the
Irishman. ``Munsher D'Himecourt, I know it's
against rules---I say, I know it's against rules to come
in here, but''---smiling,---``I want to have a private
wurd with ye. I say, I want to have a private wurd
with ye.''

  In the closet of bottles the maiden smiled triumphantly.
She also wiped the dew from her forehead,
for the place was very close and warm.

  With her father was no triumph. In him sadness
and doubt were so mingled with anger that he dared
not lift his eyes, but gazed at the knot in the wood of
the table, which looked like a caterpillar curled up.
Mazaro, he concluded, had really asked the Major to
come.

  ``Mazaro tol' you?'' he asked.

  ``Yes,'' answered the Irishman. ``Mazaro told me
I was watched, and asked''---

  ``Madjor,'' unluckily interrupted the old man, suddenly
looking up and speaking with subdued fervor,
``for w'y---iv Mazaro tol' you---for w'y you din come
more sooner? Dad is one 'eavy charge again' you.''

  ``Didn't Mazaro tell ye why I didn't come?''
asked the other, beginning to be puzzled at his host's
meaning.

  ``Yez,'' replied M. D'Hemecourt, ``bud one brev
zhenteman should not be afraid of''---

  The young man stopped him with a quiet laugh.

  ``Munsher D'Hinecourt,'' said he, ``I'm nor afraid
of any two men living---I say I'm nor afraid of any
two men living, and certainly not of the two that's
bean a-watchin' me lately, if they're the two I think
they are.''

  M. D'Hemecourt flushed in a way quite incomprehensible
to the speaker, who nevertheless continued:

  ``It was the charges,'' he said, with some slyness
in his smile. ``They _are_ heavy, as ye say, and that's
the very reason---I say that's the very reason why I
staid away, ye see, eh? I say that's the very reason
I staid away.''

  Then, indeed, there was a dew for the maiden to
wipe from her brow, unconscious that every word that
was being said bore a different significance in the mind
of each of the three. The old man was agitated.

  ``Bud, sir,'' he began, shaking his head and lifting
his hand.

  ``Bless  yer  soul,  Munsher  D'Himecourt,''  interrupted
the Irishman. ``Wut's  the  use o'grapplin'
two cut-throats, when''---

  ``Madjor Shaughnessy!'' cried M. D'Hemecourt,
losing all self-control. ``H-I am nod a cud-troad,
Madjor Shaughnessy, h-an I 'ave a r-r-righd to wdage
you.''

  The Major rose from his chair.

  ``What d'ye mean?''  he  asked  vacantly,  and  then:
``Look-ut here, Munsher D'Himecourt, one of uz is
crazy. I say one''---

  ``No, sar-r-r!'' cried the other, rising and clenching
his trembling fist. ``H-I am nod crezzy. I'ave de
righd to wadge dad man wad mague rimark aboud me
dotter.''

  ``I never did no such a thing.''

  ``You did.''

  ``I never did no such a thing.''

  ``Bud you 'ave jus hacknowledge'---''

  ``I never did no such a _thing_, I tell ye, and the
man that's told ye so is a liur.''

  ``Ah-h-h-h!'' said the old man, wagging his finger. 
``Ah-h-h-h! You call Manuel Mazaro one liar?''

  The Irishman laughed out.

  ``Well, I should say so!''

  He motioned the old man into his chair, and both
sat down again.

  ``Why, Munsher D'Himecourt, Mazaro's been
keepin' me  away from heer with a yarn about two
Spaniards watchin' for me. That's what I came in to
ask ye about. My dear sur, do ye s'pose I wud talk
about the goddess---I mean, yer daughter---to the
likes o' Mazaro---I say to the likes o' Mazaro?''

  To say the old man was at sea would be too feeble
an expression---he was in the trough of the sea, with
a hurricane of doubts and fears whirling around him. 
Somebody had told a lie, and he, having struck upon
its sunken surface, was dazed and stunned. He
opened his lips to say he knew not what, when his
ear caught the voice of Manuel Mazaro, replying to
the greeting of some of his comrades outside the front
door.

  ``He is comin'!'' cried the old man. ``Mague
you'sev hide, Madjor; do not led 'im kedge you,
Mon Dieu!''

  The Irishman smiled.

  ``The little yellow wretch!'' said he quietly, his
blue eyes dancing. ``I'm goin' to catch _him_.''

  A certain hidden hearer instantly made up her mind
to rush out between the two young men and be a
heroine.

  ``_Non, non_!'' exclaimed M. D'Hemecourt excitedly. 
``Nod in de Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s---nod now, Madjor. 
Go in dad door, hif you pliz, Madjor. You will heer
'im w'at he 'ave to say. Mague you'sev de troub'. 
Nod dad door---diz one.''

  The Major laughed again and started toward the
door indicated, but in an instant stopped.

 ``I can't go in theyre,'' he said. ``That's yer
daughter's room.''

  ``_Oui, oui, mais_!''  cried  the  other  softly,  but
Mazaro's step was near.

  ``I'll just slip in heer,'' and the amused Shaughnessy
tripped lightly to the closet door, drew it open
in spite of a momentary resistance from within which
he had no time to notice, stepped into a small recess
full of shelves and bottles, shut the door, and stood
face to face---the broad moonlight shining upon her
through a small, high-grated opening on one side---
with Pauline. At the same instant the voice of the
young Cuban sounded in the room.

  Pauline was in a great tremor. She made as if she
would have opened the door and fled, but the Irishman
gave a gesture of earnest protest and re-assurance. 
The re-opened door might make the back parlor of the
Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s a scene of blood. Thinking of this,
what could she do?  She staid.

  ``You goth a heap-a thro-vle, Se<n~>or,'' said Manuel
Mazaro, taking the seat so lately vacated. He had
patted M. D'Hemecourt tenderly on the back and the
old gentleman had flinched; hence the remark, to
which there was no reply.

  ``Was a bee crowth a' the _Caf<e'> the R<e'>fugi<e'>s_,''  continued
the young man.

  ``Bud, w'ere dad Madjor Shaughnessy?'' demanded
M. D'Hemecourt, with the little sternness he could
command.

  ``Mayor Shaughness'---yez-a; was there; boat-a,''
with a disparagrinog smile and shake of the head, ``_he_
woon-a come-a to you, Se<n~>or, oh! no.''

  The old man smiled bitterly.

  ``_Non_?'' he asked.

  ``Oh, no, Se<n~>or!''  Mazaro drew his chair closer.
``Se<n~>or;'' he paused,---``eez a-vary bath-a fore-a
you thaughter, eh?''

  ``W'at?'' asked the host, snapping like a tormented
dog.

  ``D-theze talkin' 'bou','' answered the young man;
``d-theze coffee-howces noth a goo' plaze-a fore hore,
eh?''

  The Irishman and the maiden looked into each other's
eyes an instant, as people will do when listening; but
Pauline's immediately fell, and when Mazaro's words
were understood, her blushes became visible even by
moonlight.

  ``He's r-right!'' emphatically whispered Galahad.

  She attempted to draw back a step, but found herself
against the shelves. M. D'Hemecourt had not
answered. Mazaro spoke again.

  ``Boat-a you canno' help-a, eh? I know, 'out-a she
gettin' marry, eh?''

  Pauline trembled. Her father summoned all his
force and rose as if to ask his questioner to leave
him; but the handsome Cuban motioned him down
with a gesture that seemed to beg for only a moment
more.

  ``Se<n~>or, if a-was one man whath lo-va you' thaughter,
all is possibles to lo-va.''

  Pauline, nervously braiding some bits of wire which
she had unconsciously taken from a shelf, glanced up
---against her will,---into the eyes of Galahad. They
were looking so steadily down upon her that with a
great leap of the heart for joy she closed her own and
half turned away. But Mazaro had not ceased.

  ``All is possiblee to lo-va, Se<n~>or, you shouth-a let
marry hore an' tak'n 'way frone d'these plaze, Se<n~>or.''

  ``Manuel Mazaro,'' said M. D'Hemecourt, again
rising, ``you 'ave say enough.''

  ``No, no, Se<n~>or; no, no; I want tell-a you---is
a-one man--_whath lo-va_ you' thaughter; an' I knowce
him!''

  Was there no cause for quarrel, after all? Could
it be that Mazaro was about to speak for Galahad?
The old man asked in his simplicity:

  ``Madjor Shaughnessy ?''

  Mazaro smiled mockingly.

  ``Mayor Shaughness','' he said; ``oh, no; not
Mayor Shaughness'!''

  Pauline could stay no longer; escape she must,
though it be in Manuel Mazaro's very face. Turning
again and looking up into Galahad's face in a great
flight, she opened her lips to speak, but---

  ``Mayor Shaughness','' continued the Cuban; ``_he_
nev'r-a lo-va you' thaughter.''

  Galahad was putting the maiden back from the door
with his hand.

  ``Pauline,'' he said, ``it's a lie!''

  ``An', Se<n~>or,'' pursued the Cuban, ``if a was possiblee
you' thaughter to lo-va heem, a-wouth-a be worse-a
kine in worlt; but, Se<n~>or, _I_''---

  M. D'Hemecourt made a majestic sign for silence. 
He had resumed his chair, but he rose up once more,
took the Cuban's hat from the table and tendered it to
him.

  ``Manuel Mazaro, you 'ave''---

  ``Se<n~>or, I goin' tell you''---

  ``Manuel Mazaro, you''---

  ``Boat-a, Se<n~>or''---

  ``Bud, Manuel Maz''---

  ``Se<n~>or, escuse-a me''---

  ``Huzh!'' cried the old man. ``Manuel Mazaro,you
'ave desceive' me!  You 'ave _mocque_  me, Manu''---

  ``Se<n~>or,'' cried Mazaro, ``I swear-a to you that all-a
what I sayin' ees-a''---

  He stopped aghast. Galahad and Pauline stood
before him.

  ``Is what?'' asked the blue-eyed man, with a look
of quiet delight on his face, such as Mazaro instantly
remembered to have seen on it one night when Galahad
was being shot at in the Sucking Calf Restaurant
in St. Peter Street.

  The table was between them, but Mazaro's hand
went upward toward the back of his coat-collar.

  ``Ah, ah!'' cried the Irishman, shaking his head
with a broader smile and thrusting his hand threateningly
into his breast; ``don't ye do that! just finish
yer speech.''

  ``Was-a notthin','' said the Cuban, trying to smile
back.

  ``Yer a liur,'' said Galahad.

  ``No,'' said Mazaro, still endeavoring to smile
through his agony; ``z-was on'y tellin' Se<n~>or D'Hemecourt
someteen z-was t-thrue.''

  ``And I tell ye,'' said Galahad, ``ye'r a liur, and to
be so kind an' get yersel' to the front stoop, as I'm
desiruz o' kickin' ye before the crowd.''

  ``Madjor!'' cried D'Hemecourt---

  ``Go,'' said Galahad, advancing a step toward the
Cuban.

  Had Manuel Mazaro wished to personate the prince
of darkness, his beautiful face had the correct expression
for it. He slowly turned, opened the door into the
caf<e'>, sent one glowering look behind, and disappeared.
Pauline laid her hand upon her lover's arm.

  ``Madjor,'' began her father.

  ``Oh, Madjor and Madjor,'' said the Irishman;
``Munsher D'Hemecourt, just say `Madjor, heer's a
gude wife fur ye,' and I'll let the little serpent go.''

  Thereupon, sure enough, both M. D'Hemecourt and
his daughter, rushing together, did what I have been
hoping all along, for the reader's sake, they would have
dispensed with; they burst into tears; whereupon the
Major, with his Irish appreciation of the ludicrous,
turned away to hide his smirk and began good-humoredly
to scratch himself first on the temple and then
on the thigh.

  Mazaro passed silently through the group about the
door-steps, and not many minutes afterward, Galahad
Shaughnessy, having taken a place among the exiles,
rose with the remark that the old gentleman would
doubtless be willing to tell them good-night. Good-night
was accordingly said, the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s closed
her windows, then her doors, winked a moment or two
through the cracks in the shutters and then went fast
asleep.

  The Mexican physician, at Galahad's request, told
Mazaro that at the next meeting of the burial society
he might and must occupy his accustomed seat without
fear of molestation; and he did so.

  The meeting took place some seven days after the
affair in the back parlor, and on the same ground. 
Business being finished, Galahad, who presided, stood
up, looking, in his white duck suit among his darkly-clad
companions, like a white sheep among black ones,
and begged leave to order ``dlasses'' from the front
room. I say among black sheep; yet, I suppose,
than that double row of languid, effeminate faces,
one would have been taxed to find a more harmless-looking
company. The glasses were brought and
filled.

  ``Gentlemen,'' said Galahad, ``comrades, this may
be the last time we ever meet together an unbroken
body.''

  Martinez of San Domingo, he of the horrible experience,
nodded with a lurking smile, curled a leg under
him and clasped his fingers behind his head.

  ``Who knows,'' continued the speaker, ``but Se<n~>or
Benito, though strong and sound and har'ly thirty-seven''
---here all smiled---``may be taken ill to-morrow.''

  Martinez smiled across to the tall, gray Benito on
Galahad's left, and he, in turn, smilingly showed to
the company a thin, white line of teeth between his
moustachios like distant reefs.

  ``Who knows,'' the young Irishman proceeded to
inquire, ``I say, who knows but Pedro, theyre, may
be struck wid a fever?''

  Pedro, a short, compact man of thoroughly mixed
blood, and with an eyebrow cut away, whose surname
no one knew, smiled his acknowledgments.

  ``Who knows?' resumed Galahad, when those who
understood English had explained in Spanish to those
who did not, ``but they may soon need the services
not only of our good doctor heer, but of our society;
and that Fernandez and Benigno, and Gonzalez and
Dominguez, may not be chosen to see, on that very
schooner lying at the Picayune Tier just now, their
beloved remains and so forth safely delivered into the
hands and lands of their people. I say, who knows
but it may be so!''

  The company bowed graciously as who should say,
``Well-turned phrases, Se<n~>or---well-turned.''

  ``And _amigos_, if so be that such is their approoching
fate, I will say:''

  He lifted his glass, and the rest did the same.

  ``I say, I will say to them, Creoles, countrymen,
and lovers, boun voyadge an' good luck to ye's.''

  For several moments there was much translating,
bowing, and murmured acknowledments; Mazaro
said: ``_Bueno_!'' and all around among the long
double rank of moustachioed lips amiable teeth were
gleaming, some white, some brown, some yellow, like
bones in the grass.

  ``And now, gentlemen,'' Galahad recommenced,
``fellow-exiles, once more. Munsher D'Himecourt, it
was yer practice, until lately, to reward a good talker
with a dlass from the hands o' yer daughter.'' (_Si,
si!_)  ``I'm bur a poor speaker.''  (_Si, si, Se<n~>or, z-a-fine-a
kin'-a can be; si!_) ``However, I'll ask ye,
not knowun bur it may be the last time we all meet
together, if ye will not let the goddess of the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s grace our company with her presence for just
about one minute?'' (_Yez-a, Se<n~>or; si; yez-a; oui._)

  Every head was turned toward the old man, nodding
the echoed request.

  ``Ye see, friends,'' said Galahad in a true Irish
whisper, as M. D'Hemecourt left the apartment, ``her
poseetion has been a-growin' more and more embarrassin'
daily, and the operaytions of our society were
likely to make it wurse in the future; wherefore I have
lately taken steps---I say I tuke steps this morn to
relieve the old gentleman's distresses and his daughter's''---

  He paused. M. D'Hemecourt entered with Pauline,
and the exiles all rose up. Ah!---but why say again
she was lovely?

  Galahad stepped forward to meet her, took her hand,
led her to the head of the board, and turning to the
company, said:

  ``Friends and fellow-patriots, Misthress Shaughnessy.''

  There was no outburst of astonishment---only the
same old bowing, smiling, and murmuring of compliment.
Galahad turned with a puzzled look to M.
D'Hemecourt, and guessed the truth. In the joy of
an old man's heart he had already that afternoon
told the truth to each and every man separately, as a
secret too deep for them to reveal, but too sweet for
him to keep. The Major and Pauline were man and
wife.

  The last laugh that was ever heard in the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s sounded softly through the room.

  ``Lads,'' said the Irishman. ``Fill yer dlasses.
Here's to the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s, God bless her!''

  And the meeting slowly adjourned.

  Two days later, signs and rumors of sickness began
to find place about the Caf<e'> des R<e'>fugi<e'>s, and the
Mexican physician made three calls in one day. It
was said by the people around that the tall Cuban
gentleman named Benito was very sick in one of the
back rooms. A similar frequency of the same physician's
calls was noticed about the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s.

  ``The man with one eyebrow,'' said the neighbors,
``is sick. Pauline left the house yesterday to make
room for him.''

  ``Ah! is it possible?''

  ``Yes, it is really true; she and her husband. She
took her mocking-bird with her; he carried it; he
came back alone.''

  On the next afternoon the children about the Caf<e'>
des R<e'>fugi<e'>s enjoyed the spectacle of the invalid
Cuban moved on a trestle to the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s,
although he did not look so deathly sick as they could
have liked to see him, and on the fourth morning the
doors of the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s remained closed. A
black-bordered funeral notice, veiled with crape, announced
that the great Caller-home of exiles had
served his summons upon Don Pedro Hernandez (surname
borrowed for the occasion), and Don Carlos
Mendez y Benito.

  The hour for the funeral was fixed at four P. M. It
never took place. Down at the Picayune Tier on the
river bank there was, about two o'clock that same day,
a slight commotion, and those who stood aimlessly
about a small, neat schooner, said she was ``seized.''
At four there suddenly appeared before the Caf<e'> des
Exil<e'>s a squad of men with silver crescents on their
breasts---police officers. The old cottage sat silent
with closed doors, the crape hanging heavily over the
funeral notice like a widow's veil, the little unseen
garden sending up odors from its hidden sensers, and
the old weeping-willow bending over all.

  ``Nobody here?'' asks the leader.

  The crowd which has gathered stares without answering.

  As quietly and peaceably as possible the officers pry
open the door. They enter, and the crowd pushes in
after. There are the two coffins, looking very heavy
and solid, lying in state but unguarded.

  The crowd draws a breath of astonishment. Are
they going to wrench the tops off with hatchet and
chisel?

  Rap, rap, rap; wrench, rap, wrench. Ah! the
cases come open.

  ``Well kept?'' asks the leader flippantly.

  ``Oh, yes,'' is the reply. And then all laugh.

  One of the lookers-on pushes up and gets a glimpse
within.

  ``What is it?'' ask the other idlers.

  He tells one quietly.

  ``What did he say?'' ask the rest, one of another.

  ``He says they are not dead men, but new muskets''---

  ``Here, clear out!'' cries an officer, and the loiterers
fall back and by and by straggle off.

  The exiles? What became of them, do you ask?
Why, nothing; they were not troubled, but they never
all came together again. Said a chief-of-police to
Major Shaughnessy years afterward:

  ``Major, there was only one thing that kept your
expedition from succeeding---you were too sly about
it. Had you come out flat and said what you were
doing, we'd never a-said a word to you. But that
little fellow gave us the wink, and then we had to stop
you. ''

  And was no one punished? Alas! one was. Poor,
pretty, curly-headed traitorous Mazaro! He was drawn
out of Carondelet Canal---cold, dead! And when his
wounds were counted---they were just the number of
the Caf<e'> des Exil<e'>s' children, less Galahad. But the
mother---that is, the old caf<e'>---did not see it; she had
gone up the night before in a chariot of fire.

  In the files of the old ``Picayune'' and ``Price-Current''
of 1837 may be seen the mention of Galahad
Shaughnessy among the merchants---``our enterprising
and accomplished fellow-townsman,'' and all that. 
But old M. D'Hemecourt's name is cut in marble, and
his citizenship is in ``a city whose maker and builder
is God.''

  Only yesterday I dined with the Shaughnessys---
fine old couple and handsome. Their children sat
about them and entertained me most pleasantly. But
there isn't one can tell a tale as their father can---
'twas he told me this one, though here and there my
enthusiasm may have taken liberties. He knows the
history of every old house in the French Quarter; or,
if he happens not to know a true one, he can make one
up as he goes along.
