             MADAME DELICIEUSE.




  Just adjoining the old Caf<e'> de Po<e'>sie on the corner,
stood the little one-story, yellow-washed tenement of
Dr. Mossy, with its two glass doors protected by batten
shutters, and its low, weed-grown tile roof sloping
out over the sidewalk. You were very likely to find
the Doctor in, for he was a great student and rather
negligent of his business---as business. He was a
small, sedate, Creole gentleman of thirty or more, with
a young-old face and manner that provoked instant
admiration. He would receive you---be you who you
may---in a mild, candid manner, looking into your
face with his deep blue eyes, and re-assuring you with
a modest, amiable smile, very sweet and rare on a
man's mouth.

  To be frank, the Doctor's little establishment was
dusty and disorderly---very. It was curious to see
the jars, and jars, and jars. In them were serpents
and hideous fishes and precious specimens of many
sorts. There were stuffed birds on broken perches;
and dried lizards, and eels, and little alligators, and
old skulls with their crowns sawed off, and ten thousand
odd scraps of writing-paper strewn with crumbs
of lonely lunches, and interspersed with long-lost spatulas
and rust-eaten lancets.

  All New Orleans, at least all Creole New Orleans,
knew, and yet did not know, the dear little Doctor. 
So gentle, so kind, so skilful, so patient, so lenient;
so careless of the rich and so attentive to the poor; a
man, all in all, such as, should you once love him, you
would love him forever. So very learned, too, but
with apparently no idea of how to _show himself_ to his
social profit,---two features much more smiled at than
respected, not to say admired, by a people remote
from the seats of learning, and spending most of their
esteem upon animal heroisms and exterior display.

  ``Alas!'' said his wealthy acquaintances, ``what a
pity; when he might as well be rich.''

  ``Yes, his father has plenty.''

  ``Certainly, and gives it freely. But intends his
son shall see none of it.''

  ``His son? You dare not so much as mention
him.''

  ``Well, well, how strange! But they can never
agree---not even upon their name. Is not that droll?
---a man named General Villivicencio, and his son,
Dr. Mossy!''

  ``Oh, that is nothing; it is only that the Doctor
drops the _de Villivicencio_.''

  ``Drops the _de Villivicencio?_ but I think the _de
Villivicencio_ drops him, ho, ho, ho,---_diable_!''

  Next to the residence of good Dr. Mossy towered
the narrow, red-brick-front mansion of young Madame
D<e'>licieuse, firm friend at once and always of those two
antipodes, General Villivicencio and Dr. Mossy. Its
dark, covered carriage-way was ever rumbling, and,
with nightfall, its drawing-rooms always sent forth a
luxurious light from the lace-curtained windows of the
second-story balconies.

  It was one of the sights of the Rue Royale to see
by night its tall, narrow outline reaching high up toward
the stars, with all its windows aglow.

  The Madame had had some tastes of human experience;
had been betrothed at sixteen (to a man she
did not love, ``being at that time a fool,'' as she
said); one summer day at noon had been a bride, and
at sundown---a widow. Accidental discharge of the
tipsy bridegroom's own pistol. Pass it by! It left
but one lasting effect on her, a special detestation of
quarrels and weapons.

  The little maidens whom poor parentage has doomed
to sit upon street door-sills and nurse their infant
brothers have a game of ``choosing'' the beautiful
ladies who sweep by along the pavement; but in Rue
Royale there was no choosing; every little damsel
must own Madame D<e'>licieuse or nobody, and as that
richly adorned and regal favorite of old General Villivicencio
came along they would lift their big, bold
eyes away up to her face and pour forth their admiration
in a universal---``Ah-h-h-h!''

  But, mark you, she was good Madame D<e'>licieuse as
well as fair Madame D<e'>licieuse: her principles, however,
not constructed in the austere Anglo-Saxon style,
exactly (what need, with the lattice of the Confessional
not a stone's-throw off?). Her kind offices and
beneficent schemes were almost as famous as General
Villivicencio's splendid alms; if she could at times do
what the infantile Washington said he could not, why,
no doubt she and her friends generally looked upon it
as a mere question of enterprise.

  She had charms, too, of intellect---albeit not such
a sinner against time and place as to be an ``educated
woman''---charms that, even in a plainer person,
would have brought down the half of New Orleans
upon one knee, with both hands on the left side. She
had the whole city at her feet, and, with the fine tact
which was the perfection of her character, kept it there
contented. Madame was, in short, one of the kind that
gracefully wrest from society the prerogative of doing
as they please, and had gone even to such extravagant
lengths as driving out in the _Am<e'>ricain_ faubourg,
learning the English tongue, talking national politics,
and similar freaks whereby she provoked the unbounded
worship of her less audacious lady friends. 
In the centre of the cluster of Creole beauties which
everywhere gathered about her, and, most of all, in
those incomparable companies which assembled in her
own splendid drawing-rooms, she was always queen
lily. _Her_ house, _her_ drawing-rooms, etc. ; for the
little brown aunt who lived with her was a mere piece
of curious furniture.

  There was this notable charm about Madame D<e'>licieuse,
she improved by comparison. She never looked
so grand as when, hanging on General Villivicencio's
arm at some gorgeous ball, these two bore down on
you like a royal barge lashed to a ship-of-the-line.
She never looked so like her sweet name, as when she
seated her prettiest lady adorers close around her, and
got them all a-laughing.

  Of the two balconies which overhung the _banquette_
on the front of the D<e'>licieuse house, one was a small
affair, and the other a deeper and broader one, from
which Madame and her ladies were wont upon gala
days to wave handkerchiefs and cast flowers to the
friends in the processions. There they gathered one
Eighth of January morning to see the military display. 
It was a bright blue day, and the group that quite
filled the balcony had laid wrappings aside, as all
flower-buds are apt to do on such Creole January days,
and shone resplendent in spring attire.

  The sight-seers passing below looked up by hundreds
and smiled at the ladies' eager twitter, as, flirting in
humming-bird fashion from one subject to another,
they laughed away the half-hours waiting for the
pageant. By and by they fell a-listening, for Madame
D<e'>licieuse had begun a narrative concerning Dr.
Mossy. She sat somewhat above her listeners, her
elbow on the arm of her chair, and her plump white
hand waving now and then in graceful gesture, they
silently attending with eyes full of laughter and lips
starting apart.

  ``_Vous savez_,'' she said (they conversed in French
of course), ``you know it is now long that Dr. Mossy
and his father have been in disaccord. Indeed, when
have they not differed? For, when Mossy was but a
little boy, his father thought it hard that he was not
a rowdy. He switched him once because he would not
play with his toy gun and drum. He was not so high
when his father wished to send him to Paris to enter
the French army; but he would not go. We used to
play often together on the _banquette_---for I am not
so very many years younger than he, no indeed---and,
if I wanted some fun, I had only to pull his hair and
run into the house; he would cry, and monsieur papa
would come out with his hand spread open and''---

  Madame gave her hand a malicious little sweep, and
joined heartily in the laugh which followed.

  ``That was when they lived over the way. But
wait! you shall see; I have something. This evening
the General''---

  The houses of Rue Royale gave a start and rattled
their windows. In the long, irregular line of balconies
the beauty of the city rose up. Then the houses
jumped again and the windows rattled; Madame steps
inside the window and gives a message which the
housemaid smiles at in receiving. As she turns the
houses shake again, and now again; and now there
comes a distant strain of trumpets, and by and by
the drums and bayonets and clattering hoofs, and
plumes and dancing banners; far down the long street
stretch out the shining ranks of gallant men, and the
fluttering, over-leaning swarms of ladies shower down
their sweet favors and wave their countless welcomes.

  In the front, towering above his captains, rides General
Villivicencio, veteran of 1814-15, and, with the
gracious pomp of the old-time gentleman, lifts his
cocked hat, and bows, and bows.

  Madame D<e'>'licieuse's balcony was  a  perfect  maze  of
waving kerchiefs. The General looked up for the
woman of all women; she was not there. But he remembered
the other balcony, the smaller one, and
cast his glance onward to it. There he saw Madame
and one other person only. A small blue-eyed, broad-browed,
scholarly-looking man whom the arch lady had
lured from his pen by means of a mock professional
summons, and who now stood beside her, a smile of
pleasure playing on his lips and about his eyes.

  ``_Vite_!'' said Madame, as the father's eyes met the
son's. Dr. Mossy lifted his arm and cast a bouquet
of roses. A girl in the crowd bounded forward,
caught it in the air, and, blushing, handed it to the
plumed giant. He bowed low, first to the girl, then to
the balcony above; and then, with a responsive smile,
tossed up two splendid kisses, one to Madame, and
one, it seemed---

  ``For what was that cheer?''

  ``Why, did you not see? General Villivicencio cast
a kiss to his son.''

			<*>

  The staff of General Villivicencio were a faithful few
who had not bowed the knee to any abomination of the
_Am<e'>ricains_, nor sworn deceitfully to any species of
compromise; their beloved city was presently to pass
into the throes of an election, and this band, heroically
unconscious of their feebleness, putting their trust in
``re-actions'' and like delusions, resolved to make one
more stand for the traditions of their fathers. It was
concerning this that Madame D<e'>licieuse was incidentally
about to speak when interrupted by the boom of
cannon; they had promised to meet at her house that
evening.

  They met. With very little discussion or delay (for
their minds were made up beforehand), it was decided
to announce in the French-English newspaper that, at
a meeting of leading citizens, it had been thought
consonant with the public interest to place before the
people the name of General Hercule Mossy de Villivicencio.
No explanation was considered necessary. 
All had been done in strict accordance with time-honored
customs, and if any one did not know it it was
his own fault. No eulogium was to follow, no editorial
indorsement. The two announcements were destined
to stand next morning, one on the English side
and one on the French, in severe simplicity, to be
greeted with profound gratification by a few old gentlemen
in blue cottonade, and by roars of laughter
from a rampant majority.

  As the junto were departing, sparkling Madame
D<e'>licieuse detained the General at the head of the
stairs that descended into the tiled carriage-way, to
wish she was a man, that she might vote for him.

  ``But, General,'' she said, ``had I not a beautiful
bouquet of ladies on my balcony this morning?''

  The General replied, with majestic gallantry, that
``it was as magnificent as could be expected with the
central rose wanting.'' And so Madame was disappointed,
for she was trying to force the General to
mention his son. ``I will bear this no longer; he
shall not rest,'' she had said to her little aunt, ``until
he has either kissed his son or quarrelled with him.''
To which the aunt had answered that, ``_co<u^>te que
co<u^>te_, she need not cry about it;'' nor did she. 
Though the General's compliment had foiled her
thrust, she answered gayly to the effect that enough
was enough; ``but, ah! General,'' dropping her voice
to an undertone, ``if you had heard what some of
those rosebuds said of you!''

  The old General pricked up like a country beau. 
Madame laughed to herself, ``Monsieur Peacock, I
have thee;'' but aloud she said gravely:

  ``Come into the drawing-room, if you please, and
seat yourself. You must be greatly fatigued.''

  The friends who waited below overheard the invitation.

  ``_Au revoir, G<e'>n<e'>ral_,'' said they.

  ``_Au revoir, Messieurs_,'' he answered, and followed
the lady.

  ``General,'' said she, as if her heart were overflowing,
``you have been spoken against. Please sit down.''

  ``Is that true, Madame?''

  ``Yes, General.''

  She sank into a luxurious chair.

  ``A lady said to-day---but you will be angry with
me, General.''

  ``With you, Madame? That is not possible.''

  ``I do not love to make revelations, General; but
when a noble friend is evil spoken of''---she leaned
her brow upon her thumb and forefinger, and looked
pensively at her slipper's toe peeping out at the edge
of her skirt on the rich carpet---``one's heart gets very
big.''

  ``Madame, you are  an  angel! But  what  said  she,
Madame?''

  ``Well, General, I have to tell you the whole truth,
if you will not be angry. We were all speaking at
once of handsome men. She said to me: `Well,
Madame D<e'>licieuse, you may say what you will of
General Villivicencio, and I suppose it is true; but
everybody knows'---pardon me, General, but just so
she said---`all the world knows he treats his son very
badly.' ''

  ``It is not true,'' said the General.

  ``If I wasn't angry!'' said Madame, making a
pretty fist. `How can that be?' I said. `Well,' she
said, `mamma says he has been angry with his son for
fifteen years.' `But what did his son do?' I said. 
`Nothing,' said she. `_Ma foi_,' I said, `me, I too
would be angry if my son had done nothing for fifteen
years'---ho, ho, ho!''

  ``It is not true,'' said the General.

  The old General cleared  his  throat, and  smiled  as
by compulsion.

  ``You know, General,'' said Madame, looking distressed,
``it was nothing to joke about, but I had to
say so, because I did not know what your son had
done, nor did I wish to hear any thing against one
who has the honor to call you his father.''

  She paused a moment to let the flattery take effect,
and then proceeded:

  ``But then another lady said to me; she said, ` For
shame, Clarisse, to laugh at good Dr. Mossy; nobody
---neither General Villivicencio, neither any other, has
a right to be angry against that noble, gentle, kind,
brave' ''---

  ``Brave!'' said the General, with a touch of irony.

  ``So she said,'' answered Madame D<e'>licieuse, ``and
I asked her, `how brave?' `Brave?' she said, `why,
braver than _any soldier_, in tending the smallpox, the
cholera, the fevers, and all those horrible things. Me,
I saw his father once run from a snake; I think _he_
wouldn't fight the smallpox---my faith!' she said,
`they say that Dr. Mossy does all that and never
wears a scapula!---and does it nine hundred and
ninety-nine times in a thousand for nothing! _Is_ that
brave, Madame D<e'>licieuse, or is it not?'---And, General,
---what could I say?''

  Madame dropped her palms on either side of her
spreading robes and waited pleadingly for an answer. 
There was no sound but the drumming of the General's
fingers on his sword-hilt. Madame resumed:

  ``I said, `I do not deny that Mossy is a noble gentleman;'
---I had to say that, had I not, General?''

  ``Certainly, Madame,'' said the General, ``my son
is a gentleman, yes.''

  `` `But,' I said, `he should not make Monsieur, his
father, angry.' ''

  ``True,'' said the General, eagerly.

  ``But that lady said: `Monsieur, his father, makes
himself angry,' she said. `Do you know, Madame,
why his father is angry so long?' Another lady says,
`I know!' `For what?' said I. `Because he refused
to become a soldier; mamma told me that.' `It cannot
be!' I said.''

  The General flushed. Madame saw it, but relentlessly
continued:

  `` `_Mais oui_,' said that lady. `What!' I said,
`think you General Villivicencio will not rather be the
very man most certain to respect a son who has the
courage to be his own master? Oh, what does he
want with a poor fool of a son who will do only as he
says? You think he will love him less for healing
instead of killing? Mesdemoiselles, you do not know
that noble soldier!' ''

  The noble soldier glowed, and bowed his acknowledgments
in a dubious, half remonstrative way, as if
Madame might be producing material for her next
confession, as, indeed, she diligently was doing; but
she went straight on once more, as a surgeon would.

  ``But that other lady said : `No Madame, no, ladies
but I am going to tell you why Monsieur, the General,
is angry with his son.' ` Very well, why?'- `Why?
It is just---because---he is---a little man!' ''

  General Villivicencio stood straight up.

  ``Ah! mon ami,'' cried the lady, rising excitedly,
``I have wounded you and made you angry, with my
silly revelations. Pardon me, my friend. Those were
foolish girls, and, anyhow, they admired you. They
said you looked glorious---grand---at the head of the
procession.''

  Now, all at once, the General felt the tremendous
fatigues of the day; there was a wild, swimming,
whirling sensation in his head that forced him to let
his eyelids sink down; yet, just there, in the midst
of his painful bewilderment, he realized with ecstatic
complacency that the most martial-looking man in
Louisiana was standing in his spurs with the hand of
Louisiana's queenliest woman laid tenderly on his
arm.

  ``I am a wretched tattler!'' said she.

  ``Ah! no, Madame, you are my dearest friend, yes.''

  ``Well, anyhow, I called them fools. `Ah! innocent
creatures,' I said, `think you a man of his sense
and goodness, giving his thousands to the sick and
afflicted, will cease to love his only son because he is
not big like a horse or quarrelsome like a dog? No,
ladies, there is a great reason which none of you
know.' ` Well, well,' they cried, `tell it; he has need
of a very good reason; tell it now.' `My ladies,' I
said, `I must not'---for, General, for all the world
I knew not a reason why you should be angry against
your son; you know, General, you have never told
me.''

  The beauty again laid her hand on his arm and
gazed, with round-eyed simplicity, into his sombre
countenance. For an instant her witchery had almost
conquered.

  ``Nay, Madame, some day I shall tell you; I have
more than one burden _here_. But let me ask you to be
seated, for I have a question, also, for you, which I
have longed to ask. It lies heavily upon my heart; I
must ask it now. A matter of so great importance''---
Madame's little brown aunt gave a faint cough from
a dim corner of the room.

  `` 'Tis a beautiful night,'' she remarked, and stepped
out on the balcony.

  Then the General asked his question. It was a very
long question, or, maybe, repeated twice or thrice; for
it was fully ten minutes before he moved out of the
room, saying good-evening.

  Ah! old General Villivicencio. The most martial-looking
man in Louisiana! But what would the people,
the people who cheered in the morning, have said,
to see the fair Queen D<e'>licieuse at the top of the stair,
sweetly bowing you down into the starlight,---humbled,
crestfallen, rejected!

			<*>

  The campaign opened. The Villivicencio ticket
was read in French and English with the very different
sentiments already noted. In the Exchange,
about the courts, among the ``banks,'' there was
lively talking concerning its intrinsic excellence and
extrinsic chances. The young gentlemen who stood
about the doors of the so-called ``coffee-houses''
talked with a frantic energy alarming to any stranger,
and just when you would have expected to see them
jump and bite large mouthfuls out of each other's
face, they would turn and enter the door, talking on
in the same furious manner, and, walking up to the
bar, click their glasses to the success of the Villivicencio
ticket. Sundry swarthy and wrinkled remnants
of an earlier generation were still more enthusiastic. 
There was to be a happy renaissance; a purging out
of Yankee ideas; a blessed home-coming of those good
old Bourbon morals and manners which Yankee notions
had expatriated. In the cheerfulness of their
anticipations they even went the length of throwing
their feet high in air, thus indicating how the Villivicencio
ticket was going to give ``doze Am<e'>ricains''
the kick under the nose.

  In the three or four weeks which followed, the
General gathered a surfeit of adulation, notwithstanding
which he was constantly and with pain imagining
a confused chatter of ladies, and when he shut his
eyes with annoyance, there was Madame D<e'>licieuse
standing, and saying, ``I knew not a reason why you
should be angry against your son,'' gazing in his face
with hardened simplicity, and then---that last scene
on the stairs wherein he seemed still to be descending,
down, down.

  Madame herself was keeping good her resolution.

  ``Now or never,'' she said, ``a  reconciliation  or  a
quarrel.''

  When the General, to keep up appearances, called
again, she so moved him with an account of certain
kindly speeches of her own invention, which she imputed
to Dr. Mossy, that he promised to call and see
his son; ``perhaps;'' ``pretty soon;'' ``probably.''

  Dr. Mossy, sitting one February morning among his
specimens and books of reference, finishing a thrilling
chapter on the cuticle, too absorbed to hear a door
open, suddenly realized that something was in his
light, and, looking up, beheld General Villivicencio
standing over him. Breathing a pleased sigh, he put
down his pen, and, rising on tiptoe, laid his hand upon
his father's shoulder, and lifting his lips like a little
wife, kissed him.

  ``Be seated, papa,'' he said, offering his own chair,
and perching on the desk,

  The General took it, and, clearing his throat, gazed
around upon the jars and jars with their little Adams
and Eves in zo<o:>logical gardens.

  ``Is all going well, papa?'' finally asked Dr. Mossy.

  ``Yes.''

  Then there was a long pause.

  `` 'Tis a beautiful day,'' said the son.

  ``Very beautiful,'' rejoined the father.

  ``I thought there would have been a rain, but it has
cleared off,'' said the son.

  ``Yes,'' responded the father, and drummed on the
desk.

  ``Does it appear to be turning cool?'' asked the
son.

  ``No; it does not appear to be turning cool at all,''
was the answer.

  ``H'm 'm!'' said Dr. Mossy.

  ``Hem!'' said General Villivicencio.

  Dr. Mossy, not realizing his own action, stole a
glance at his manuscript.

  ``I am interrupting you,'' said the General, quickly,
and rose.

  ``No, no! pardon me; be seated; it gives me great
pleasure to---I did not know what I was doing. It is
the work with which I fill my leisure moments.''

  So the General settled down again, and father and
son sat very close to each other---in a bodily sense ;
spiritually they were many miles apart. The General's
finger-ends, softly tapping the desk, had the sound of
far-away drums.

  ``The city---it is healthy?'' asked the General.

  ``Did you ask me if''---said the little Doctor, starting
and looking up.

  ``The city---it has not much sickness at present?''
repeated the father.

  ``No, yes---not much,'' said Mossy, and, with
latter unconsciousness, leaned down upon his elbow
and supplied an omitted word to the manuscript.

  The General was on his feet as if by the touch of a
spring.

  ``I must go!''

  ``Ah! no, papa,'' said the son.

  ``But, yes, I must.''

  ``But wait, papa, I had just now something to speak
of''---

  ``Well?'' said the General, standing with his hand
on the door, and with rather a dark countenance.

  Dr. Mossy touched his fingers to his forehead, trying
to remember.

  ``I fear I have---ah! I rejoice to see your name
before the public, dear papa, and at the head of the
ticket.''

  The General's displeasure sank down like an eagle's
feathers. He smiled thankfully, and bowed.

  ``My friends compelled me,'' he said.

  ``They think you will be elected?''

  ``They will not doubt it. But what think you, my
son?''

  Now the son had a conviction which it would have
been madness to express, so he only said:

  ``They could not elect one more faithful.''

  The General bowed solemnly.

  ``Perhaps the  people  will  think  so;  my  friends  believe
they will.''

  ``Your friends who have used your name should
help you as much as they can, papa,'' said the Doctor.
``Myself, I should like to assist you, papa, if I could.''

  ``A-bah!'' said the pleased father, incredulously.

  ``But, yes,'' said the son.

  A thrill of delight filled the General's frame. _This_
was like a son.

  ``Thank you, my son! I thank you much. Ah,
Mossy, my dear boy, you make me happy!''

  ``But,'' added Mossy, realizing with a tremor how
far he had gone, ``I see not how it is possible.''

  The General's chin dropped.

  ``Not being a public man,'' continued the Doctor;
``unless, indeed, my pen---you might enlist my pen.''

  He paused with a smile of bashful inquiry. The
General stood aghast for a moment, and then caught
the idea.

  ``Certainly! cer-tain-ly! ha, ha, ha! backing
out of the door---``certainly! Ah! Mossy, you are
right, to be sure; to make a complete world we must
have swords _and_ pens. Well, my son, `_au revoir_;'
no, I cannot stay---I will return. I hasten to tell my
friends that the pen of Dr. Mossy is on our side!
Adieu, dear son.''

  Standing outside on the _banquette_ he bowed---not
to Dr. Mossy, but to the balcony of the big red-brick
front---a most sunshiny smile, and departed.

  The very next morning, as if fate had ordered it,
the Villivicencio ticket was attacked---ambushed, as
it were, from behind the Am<e'>ricain newspaper. The
onslaught was---at least General Villivicencio said it
was---absolutely ruffianly. Never had all the lofty
courtesies and formalities of chivalric contest been so
completely ignored. Poisoned balls---at least personal
epithets---were used. The General himself was
called ``antiquated!'' The friends who had nominated
him, they were positively sneered at; dubbed
``fossils,'' ``old ladies,'' and their caucus termed
``irresponsible''---thunder and lightning! gentlemen
of honor to be termed ``not responsible!'' It was
asserted that the nomination was made secretly, in a
private house, by two or three unauthorized harum-scarums
(that touched the very bone) who had with
more caution than propriety withheld their names. 
The article was headed, ``The Crayfish-eaters' Ticket.''
It continued further to say that, had not the publication
of this ticket been regarded as a dull hoax, it
would not have been suffered to pass for two weeks
unchallenged, and that it was now high time the universal
wish should be realized in its withdrawal.

  Among the earliest readers of this production was
the young Madame. She first enjoyed a quiet gleeful
smile over it, and then called:

  ``Ninide, here, take this down to Dr. Mossy---
stop.'' She marked the communication heavily with
her gold pencil. ``No answer; he need not return it.''

  About the same hour, and in a neighboring street,
one of the ``not responsibles'' knocked on the Villivicencio
castle gate. The General invited him into
his bedroom. With a short and strictly profane harangue
the visitor produced the offensive newspaper,
and was about to begin reading, when one of those
loud nasal blasts, so peculiar to the Gaul, resounded
at the gate, and another ``not responsible'' entered,
more excited, if possible, than the first. Several
minutes were spent in exchanging fierce sentiments
and slapping the palm of the left hand rapidly with
the back of the right. Presently there was a pause
for breath.

  ``Alphonse, proceed to read,'' said the General,
sitting up in bed.

  ``De Crayfish-eaters' Ticket''---began Alphonse;
but a third rapping at the gate interrupted him, and a
third ``irresponsible'' re-enforced their number, talking
loudly and wildly to the waiting-man as he came up
the hall.

  Finally, Alphonse read the article. Little by little
the incensed gentlemen gave it a hearing, now two
words and now three, interrupting it to rip out long,
rasping maledictions, and wag their forefingers at each
other as they strode ferociously about the apartment.

  As Alphonse reached the close, and dashed the
paper to the floor, the whole quartet, in terrific unison,
cried for the blood of the editor.

  But hereupon the General spoke with authority.

  ``No, Messieurs,'' he said, buttoning  his  dressinggown,
savagely, ``you shall not fight him. I forbid it---
you shall not!''

  ``But,'' cried the three at once, ``one of us must
fight, and you---you cannot; if _you_ fight our cause is
lost! The candidate must not fight.''

  ``Hah-h! Messieurs,'' cried the hero, beating his
breast and lifting his eyes, ``_grace au ciel_. I have a
son. Yes, my beloved friends, a son who shall call
the villain out and make him pay for his impudence
with blood, or eat his words in to-morrow morning's
paper. Heaven be thanked that gave me a son for
this occasion! I shall see him at once---as soon as
I can dress.''

  ``We will go with you.''

  ``No, gentlemen, let me see my son alone. I can
meet you at Maspero's in two hours. Adieu, my dear
friends.''

  He was resolved.

  ``_Au revoir_,'' said the dear friends.

  Shortly after, cane in hand, General Villivicencio
moved with an ireful stride up the _banquette_ of Rue
Royale. Just as he passed the red-brick front one of
the batten shutters opened the faintest bit, and a certain
pair of lovely eyes looked after him, without any
of that round simplicity which we have before discovered
in them. As he half turned to knock at his son's
door he glanced at this very shutter, but it was as
tightly closed as though the house were an enchanted
palace.

  Dr. Mossy's door, on the contrary, swung ajar when
he knocked, and the General entered.

  ``Well, my son, have you seen that newspaper?
No, I think not. I _see_ you have not, since your cheeks
are not red with shame and anger.''

  Dr. Mossy looked up with astonishment from the
desk where he sat writing.

  ``What is that, papa?''

  ``My faith! Mossy, is it possible you have not
heard of the attack upon me, which has surprised and
exasperated the city this morning?''

  ``No,'' said Dr. Mossy, with still greater surprise,
and laying his hand on the arm of his chair.

  His father put on a dying look. ``My soul!'' At
that moment his glance fell upon the paper which had
been sent in by Madame Delicieuse. ``But, Mossy,
my son,'' he screamed, ``_there_ it is!'' striking it rapidly
with one finger---``there! there! there! read it!
It calls me `not responsible!' `not responsible' it
calls me! Read! read!''

  ``But, papa,'' said the quiet little Doctor, rising,
and accepting the crumpled paper thrust at him, ``I
have read this. If this is it, well, then, already I am
preparing to respond to it.''

  The General seized him violently, and, spreading a
suffocating kiss on his face, sealed it with an affectionate
oath.

  ``Ah, Mossy, my boy, you are glorious! You had
begun already to write! You are glorious! Read to
me what you have written, my son.''

  The Doctor took up a bit of manuscript, and resuming
 his chair, began:

  ``Messrs. Editors: On your journal of this morning''---

  ``Eh! how! you have not written it in English, is
it, son?''

  ``But, yes, papa.''

  `` 'Tis a vile tongue,'' said the General; ``but, if  it
is necessary---proceed.''

    ``Messrs. Editors: On your journal of this morning is
  published an editorial article upon the Villivicencio ticket,
  which is plentiful and abundant with mistakes. Who is the
  author or writer of the above said editorial article your correspondent
  does at present ignore, but doubts not he is one who,
  hasty to form an opinion, will yet, however, make his assent to
  the correction of some errors and mistakes which''---

  ``Bah!'' cried the General.

  Dr. Mossy looked up, blushing crimson.

  ``Bah!'' cried the General, still more forcibly.
``B<e^>tise!''

  ``How?'' asked the gentle son.

  `` 'Tis all nonsent!'' cried the General, bursting
into English. ``Hall you 'ave to say is: ` 'Sieur
Editeurs! I want you s'all give de nem of de indignan'
scoundrel who meek some lies on you' paper
about mon p<e`>re et ses amis!''

  ``Ah-h!'' said Dr. Mossy, in a tone of derision
and anger.

  His father gazed at him in mute astonishment. He
stood beside his disorderly little desk, his small form
drawn up, a hand thrust into his breast, and that look
of invincibility in his eyes such as blue eyes sometimes
surprise us with.

  ``You want me to fight,'' he said.

  ``My faith!'' gasped the General, loosening in all
his joints. ``I believe---you may cut me in pieces if
I do not believe you were going to reason it out in the
newspaper! Fight? If I want you to fight? Upon
my soul, I believe you do not want to fight!''

  ``No,'' said Mossy.

  ``My God!'' whispered the General. His heart
seemed to break.

  ``Yes,'' said the steadily gazing Doctor, his lips
trembling as he opened them. ``Yes, your God. I
am afraid''---

  ``Afraid!'' gasped the General.

  ``Yes,'' rang out the Doctor, ``afraid; afraid!
God forbid that I should not be afraid. But I will
tell you what I do not fear---I do not fear to call your
affairs of honor---murder!''

  ``My son!'' cried the father.

  ``I retract,'' cried the son;  ``consider  it  unsaid. I
will never reproach my father.''

  ``It is well,'' said the father. ``I was wrong. It
is my quarrel. I go to settle it myself.''

  Dr. Mossy moved quickly between his father and
the door. General Villivicencio stood before him
utterly bowed down.

  ``What will you?'' sadly demanded the old man.

  ``Papa,'' said the son, with much tenderness, ``I
cannot permit you. Fifteen years we were strangers,
and yesterday were friends. You must not leave me
so. I will even settle this quarrel for you. You must
let me. I am pledged to your service.''

  The peace-loving little doctor did not mean ``to
settle,'' but ``to adjust.'' He felt in an instant that
he was misunderstood; yet, as quiet people axe apt to
do, though not wishing to deceive, he let the misinterpretation
stand. In his embarrassment he did not
know with absolute certainty what he should do himself.

  The father's face---he thought of but one way to
settle a quarrel---began instantly to brighten. ``I
would myself do it,'' he said, apologetically, ``but my
friends forbid it.''

  ``And so do I,'' said the Doctor, ``but I will go
myself now, and will not return until all is finished. 
Give me the paper.''

  ``My son, I do not wish to compel you.''

  There was something acid in the Doctor's smile as
he answered:

  ``No; but give me the paper, if you please.''

  The General handed it.

  ``Papa,'' said the son, ``you must wait here for my
return.''

  ``But I have an appointment at Maspero's at''---

  ``I will call and make excuse for you,'' said the
son.

  ``Well,'' consented the almost happy father, ``go,
my son; I will stay. But if some of your sick shall
call?''

  ``Sit quiet,'' said the son. ``They will think no
one is here.'' And the General noticed that the dust
lay so thick on the panes that a person outside would
have to put his face close to the glass to see within.

  In the course of half an hour the Doctor had reached
the newspaper office, thrice addressed himself to the
wrong person, finally found the courteous editor, and
easily convinced him that his father had been imposed
upon ; but when Dr. Mossy went farther, and asked
which one of the talented editorial staff had written
the article:

  ``You see, Doctor,'' said the editor---``just step
into my private office a moment.''

  They went in together. The next minute saw Dr.
Mossy departing hurriedly from the place, while the
editor complacently resumed his pen, assured that he
would not return.

  General Villivicencio sat and waited among the serpents
and innocents. His spirits began to droop
again. Revolving Mossy's words, he could not escape
the fear that possibly, after all, his son might compromise
the Villivicencio honor in the interests of peace. 
Not that he preferred to put his son's life in jeopardy;
he would not object to an adjustment, provided the
enemy should beg for it. But if not, whom would his
son select to perform those friendly offices indispensable
in polite quarrels? Some half-priest, half-woman?
Some spectacled book-worm? He suffered.

  The monotony of his passive task was relieved by
one or two callers who had the sagacity (or bad manners)
to peer through the dirty glass, and then open
the door, to whom, half rising from his chair, he
answered, with a polite smile, that the Doctor was out,
nor could he say how long he might be absent. Still
the time dragged painfully, and he began at length to
wonder why Mossy did not return.

  There came a rap at the glass door different from all
the raps that had forerun it---a fearless, but gentle,
dignified, graceful rap; and the General, before he
looked round, felt in all his veins that it came from
the young Madame. Yes, there was her glorious outline
thrown sidewise upon the glass. He hastened
and threw open the door, bending low at the same
instant, and extending his hand.

  She extended hers also, but not to take his. With
a calm dexterity that took the General's breath, she
reached between him and the door, and closed it.

  ``What is the matter?'' anxiously asked the General
---for her face, in spite of its smile, was severe.

  ``General,'' she began, ignoring his inquiry---and,
with all her Creole bows, smiles, and insinuating
phrases, the severity of her countenance but partially
waned---``I came to see my physician---your son. 
Ah! General, when I find you reconciled to your son,
it makes me think I am in heaven. You will let me
say so? You will not be offended with the old playmate
of your son?''

  She gave him no time to answer.

  ``He is out, I think, is he not? But I am glad of
it. It gives us occasion to rejoice together over his
many merits. For you know, General, in all the years
of your estrangement, Mossy had no friend like myself. 
I am proud to tell you so now; is it not so?''

  The General was so taken aback that, when he had
thanked her in a mechanical way, he could say nothing
else. She seemed to fall for a little while into a
sad meditation that embarrassed him beyond measure. 
But as he opened his mouth to speak, she resumed:

  ``Nobody knew him so well as I; though I, poor
me, I could not altogether understand him; for look
you, General, he was---what do you think?---_a great
man!_---nothing less.''

  ``How?'' asked the General, not knowing what else
to respond.

  ``You never dreamed of that, eh?'' continued the
lady. ``But, of course not; nobody did but me. 
Some of those Am<e'>ricains, I suppose, knew it; but
who would ever ask them? Here in Royal Street, in
New Orleans, where we people know nothing and care
nothing but for meat, drink, and pleasure, he was only
Dr. Mossy, who gave pills. My faith! General, no
wonder you were disappointed in your son, for you
thought the same. Ah! yes, you did! But why did
you not ask me, his old playmate? I knew better. I
could have told you how your little son stood head and
shoulders above the crowd. I could have told you
some things too wonderful to believe. I could have
told you that his name was known and honored in the
scientific schools of Paris, of London, of Germany!
Yes! I could have shown you''---she warmed as she
proceeded---``I could have shown you letters (I
begged them of him), written as between brother
and brother, from the foremost men of science and
discovery!''

  She stood up, her eyes flashing with excitement.

  ``But why did you never tell me?'' cried the General.

  ``He never would allow me---but you---why did
you not ask me? I will tell you; you were too proud
to mention your son. But he had pride to match yours
---ha!---achieving all---every thing---with an assumed
name! `Let me tell your father,' I implored him;
but---`let him find me out,' he said, and you never
found him out. Ah! there he was fine. He would
not, he said, though only for your sake, re-enter your
affections as any thing more or less than just---your
son. Ha!''

  And so she went on. Twenty times the old General
was astonished anew, twenty times was angry or
alarmed enough to cry out, but twenty times she would
not be interrupted. Once he attempted to laugh, but
again her hand commanded silence.

  ``Behold, Monsieur, all these dusty specimens, these
revolting fragments. How have you blushed to know
that our idle people laugh in their sleeves at these
things! How have you blushed---and you his father!
But why did you not ask me? I could have told you:
`Sir, your son is not an apothecary; not one of these
ugly things but has helped him on in the glorious path
of discovery ; discovery, General---your son---known
in Europe as a scientific discoverer!' Ah-h! the blind
people say, `How is that, that General Villivicencio
should be dissatisfied with his son? He is a good man,
and a good doctor, only a little careless, that's all.'
But _you_ were more blind still, for you shut your eyes
tight like this; when, had you searched for his virtues
as you did for his faults, you, too, might have known
before it was too late what nobility, what beauty,
what strength, were in the character of your poor,
poor son!''

  ``Just Heaven! Madame, you shall not speak of
my son as of one dead and buried! But, if you have
some bad news''---

  ``Your son took your quarrel on his hands, eh?''

  ``I believe so---I think''---

  ``Well; I saw him an hour ago in search of your
slanderer!''

  ``He must find him!'' said the General, plucking
up.

  ``But if the search is already over,'' slowly responded
Madame.

  The father looked one instant in her face, then rose
with an exclamation:

  ``Where is my son? What has happened? Do
you think I am a child, to be trifled with---a horse
to be teased? Tell me of my son!''

  Madame was stricken with genuine anguish.

  ``Take your chair,'' she begged; ``wait; listen;
take your chair.''

  ``Never!'' cried the General; ``I am going to find
my son---my God! Madame, you have _locked this
door!_ What are you, that you should treat me so?
Give me, this instant''---

  ``Oh! Monsieur, I beseech you to take your chair,
and I will tell you all. You can do nothing now. 
Listen! suppose you should rush out and find that
your son had played the coward at last! Sit down
and''---

  ``Ah! Madame, this is play!'' cried  the  distracted
man.

  ``But no; it is not play. Sit down; I want to ask
you something.''

  He sank down and she stood over him, anguish and
triumph strangely mingled in her beautiful face.

  ``General, tell me true; did you not force this quarrel
into your son's hand? I know he would not choose
to have it. Did you not do it to test his courage,
because all these fifteen years you have made yourself
a fool with the fear that he became a student only to
escape being a soldier? Did you not?''

  Her eyes looked him through and through.

  ``And if I did?'' demanded he with faint defiance.

  `` Yes! and if he has made dreadful haste and
proved his courage?'' asked she.

  ``Well, then,''---the General straightened up triumphantly
---``then he is my son!''

  He beat the desk.

  ``And heir to your wealth, for example?''

  ``Certainly.''

  The lady bowed in solemn mockery.

  ``It will make him a magnificent funeral!''

  The father bounded up and stood speechless, trembling
from head to foot. Madame looked straight in
his eye.

  ``Your son has met the writer of that article.''

  ``Where?'' the old man's lips tried to ask.

  ``Suddenly, unexpectedly, in a passage-way.''

  ``My God! and the villain''---

  ``Lives!'' cried Madame.

He rushed to the door, forgetting that it was locked.
``Give me that key!'' he cried, wrenched at the
knob, turned away bewildered, turned again toward it,
and again away; and at every step and turn he cried,

  ``Oh! my son, my son! I have killed my son! Oh!
Mossy, my son, my little boy! Oh! my son, my son!''

  Madame buried her face in her hands and sobbed
aloud. Then the father hushed his cries and stood for
a moment before her.

  ``Give me the key, Clarisse, let me go.''

  She rose and laid her face on his shoulder.

  ``What is it, Clarisse?'' asked he.

  ``Your son and I were ten years betrothed.''

  ``Oh, my child!''

  ``Because, being disinherited, he would not be my
husband.''

  ``Alas! would to God I had known it! Oh! Mossy,
my son.''

  ``Oh! Monsieur,'' cried the lady, clasping her hands ,
``forgive me---morn no more---your son is unharmed!
I wrote the article---I am your recanting
slanderer! Your son is hunting for me now. I told
my aunt to misdirect him. I slipped by him unseen
in the carriage-way.''

  The wild old General, having already staggered back
and rushed forward again, would have seized her in
his arms, had not the little Doctor himself at that instant
violently rattled the door and shook his finger at
them playfully as he peered through the glass.

  ``Behold!'' said Madame, attempting a smile:
``open to your son; here is the key."''

  She sank into a chair.

  Father and son leaped into each other's arms; then
turned to Madame:

  ``Ah! thou lovely mischief-maker''---

  She had fainted away.

  ``Ah! well, keep out of the way, if you please,
papa,'' said Dr. Mossy, as Madame presently reopened
her eyes; ``no wonder you fainted; you have
finished some hard work---see; here; so; Clarisse,
dear, take this.''

  Father and son stood side by side, tenderly regarding
her as she revived.

  ``Now, papa, you may kiss her; she is quite herself
again, already.''

  ``My daughter!'' said the stately General; ``this
---is my son's ransom; and, with this,---I withdraw
the Villivicencio ticket.''

  ``You shall not,'' exclaimed the laughing lady,
throwing her arms about his neck.

  ``But, yes!'' he insisted ; ``my faith! you will at
least allow me to remove my dead from the field.''

  ``But, certainly;'' said the son; ``see, Clarisse, here
is Madame, your aunt, asking us all into the house. 
Let us go.''

  The group passed out into the Rue Royale, Dr.
Mossy shutting the door behind them. The sky was
blue, the air was soft and balmy, and on the sweet
south breeze, to which the old General bared his grateful
brow, floated a ravishing odor of---

  ``Ah! what is it?'' the veteran asked of the younger
pair, seeing the little aunt glance at them with a playful
smile.

  Madame D<e'>licieuse, for almost the first time in her
life, and Dr. Mossy for the thousandth---blushed.

  It was the odor of orange-blossoms.
