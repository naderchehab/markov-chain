There are also puncuation marks but not included here. IHistory, the morse code was first transmitted from one point to another in1844. It was developed by just looking at the printing press collection ofletters and by counting each letter, a pattern was found where the letters E,T, I, A, N, R, M are the most numerous and so they are given shorter morsecodes. that does not take as long to transmit words. This was the basis oflong distance communication and Telegraph was born. Signals travelled alongthe poles beside rail road tracks since the rail road was cross-country andwas a direct route between Telegraph repeater sites (evey 40 miles the signalneeds to be repeated) and it was easy to evesdrop as relays were used at thesites.For more information, check your encyclopedia or CD-ROM version.                           Morse Code     Morse code is composed of dots and dashes, it's used bycommercial and amateur stations in everywhere on earth.  It wasdeveloped by just looking at the printing press collection ofletters and by counting each letter, a pattern was found where theletters E, T, I, A, N, R, M are the most numerous and so they aregiven shorter morse codes, that does not take as long to transmitwords. This was the basis of long distance communication andTelegraph was born. Signals travelled along the poles beside railroad tracks since the rail road was cross-country andwas a direct route between Telegraph repeater sites (every 40 milesthe signal needs to be repeated) and it was easy to drop as relayswere used at the sites.     The inventer of Morse code is Samuel F. B. Morse.  Samuel wasborn in Charlestown, Massachusetts on April 27, 1791.  He enteredYale University when he was 14 years old, and went to England tostudy art when he finished university.  He went back to UnitedStates in 1815 and married Lucretia Pickering Walker in 1818.  In1825, his wife died, while he was away from the city.  He learnedhis wife died after three days because the lack of transportation. So he thought of a way to send message over great distances withthe use of an electromagnet, wires and batteries.  He quitted hiscareer of being an artist and starting to work on his invention. He applied for a patent on his invention in 1837.  He  sent thefirst message from Capital in Washington on May 24, 1844.  Themessage is,"What hath God wrought!" and it's received in Baltimorealmost as soon as it was sent!!The Alphabet and the Numbers are:A .-   B -... C -.-. D -..   E .    F ..-.G --.  H ....
