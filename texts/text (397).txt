DEAD LOVE
Algernon Charles Swinburne

PRAY a little for dead love!
      Put your hands up in a prayer,
Kiss the lips that will not move,
      Smooth the ruffled plaits of hair,
Then go forth, and bid me know
That an old love ended so.

Weep a little for poor love!
      Ere they bury him away,
Stoop your face his face above,
      Let no other hear you pray.
Then go forth and never know
That your love was buried so.

Is there any help for love?
      He is stricken to the heart,
And his white face does not move
      And the lips are drawn apart.
Nay, go forth that all may know
This was love that ended so.

Weep not any more for love
      That is dead and laid away.
All the spring is green above,
      Men would laugh to hear you pray.
It was in the time of snow
That your love was buried so.

Pray not any prayer for love,
      Plant no flowers about his bed,
For the cold heart will not move
      Though you weep that love is dead.
Sing new songs and bid me know
That love's pain is ended so.
